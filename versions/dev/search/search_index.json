BetonQuest is an advanced and powerful quest plugin. It offers RPG-style conversations with NPCs and a very flexible quest system. The multi-path conversations can be displayed in many ways ranging from basic clickable chat output, to all-new technologies. BetonQuest is not limited to simple, repetitive quests but can also power highly flexible quests that have never been seen before. This is made possible by support for more than 20 other plugins such as Citizens, Heroes, JobsReborn, Magic, McMMO and MythicMobs. You can also interact with other quest plugins such as \"Quests\" to maintain compatibility with existing Quests on your server. However, BetonQuest is not made for intense scripting ! You can write player based scripts with BetonQuest but we support hooking into Denizen and Skript for a reason ! These plugins allow for far more comfortable (server) scripting! For more information please visit the page that fits your needs the most: Im a server owner! Im a quester! I want to contribute! Im a developer and want to add support for my plugin!","title":"Welcome!"},{"location":"Features/","text":"Feature List \u00b6 This page will give you an overview of nearly all of BetonQuests features. Multi-threaded conversations \u00b6 Players can have immersive conversation with NPC's by utilizing BetonQuests Multi-Path-Conversation System. Questers can freely define multi-threaded stories, narrated with NPC conversations, and with multiple endings that affect a player's gameplay differently. Questers can also choose between five different styles to display their conversations: Beautiful Conversations \u00b6 Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Custom Notification System \u00b6 Questers can make use of BetonQuests notifyIO system that provides access to all of Minecafts GUI elements to display notifications. Therefore you can provide information to your players like so: [Video with all the NotifyIO types] BetonQuest makes it possible to provide NPC conversations in any language. Each player can set his own language which means that - if translated - all conversations will be in the players native language. You can give players information about where they are in a quest using the \"Journal\". The Journal is a book in which you can write content based on the players actions. [Upcoming] First Class Item System \u00b6 BetonQuest allows for item customization far beyond what other plugins can do. You can use ANY item from ANY plugin in your quests as rewards or conditions. BetonQuest also features a set of powerful item flags that will add non-vanilla behaviour to your items. For example, you could make a proper \"Quest Item\" that cannot be dropped and won't be dropped when the player dies. This system is really powerful, read the final concept to get an idea of what will be possible. Countless Integrations \u00b6 BetonQuest supports dozens of plugins, ranging from standard plugins like WorldGuard/WorldEdit and Citizens to more advanced ones such as EffectLib. It also offers support for other quest plugins, so you can just keep your old quests and create further additions to your quest lines based upon the progress in your old plugin. If just Beton isn't enough you can always just hook into Skript or Denizen too.

First option if you're using Eclipse: Create a folder called lib in your project folder. Put BetonQuest.jar in this folder. Refresh your project in Eclipse. In Eclipse Project Explorer right click on BetonQuest.jar and select Build Path -> Add to Build Path . And if you're using Maven simply add this (temporary repo) to your pom.xml : <repositories> <repository> <id> betonquest-repo </id> <url> http://amberproject.net:8082/repository/AmberProject/ </url> </repository> </repositories> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId> pl.betoncraft </groupId> <artifactId> betonquest </artifactId> <version> 1.12.0-SNAPSHOT </version> </dependency> </dependencies> The version you need to choose must be 1.12.0 or newer. If you want to use dev builds use X.X.X-SNAPSHOT . Check amberproject.net:8082/repository/AmberProject/ if you are not sure Writing events \u00b6 Writing events is the easiest. You need to create a class extending QuestEvent for each new event. The constructor must take one argument, an Instruction object. In the constructor you must extract all information from the instruction, for example skill names, locations etc. The description of the Instruction class is down below. Don't worry about checking event conditions, these are handled by the rest of BetonQuest's logic. Events are not bound to any player so firing it is done through fire(String playerID) method. You have to override it with your code responsible for doing stuff your event should do. Here you should use data previously parsed by the constructor. Don't access Instruction object here, it will lower the performance. You can convert playerID to Player object using the PlayerConverter class (it's a relict of times when both UUIDs and names could be used in Bukkit to identify players). If you want your event to be persistent , you need to set super.persistent variable to true in the constructor. This will make BetonQuest run this event even if the playerID points to an offline player, so prepare your code for that. If you want your event to be static , you need to set super.staticness variable to true in the constructor. This will allow BetonQuest to run this event with playerID set to null , so prepare your code for that. When you'll finish your class you need to invoke registerEvents(String name, Class<? extends QuestEvent> class) from BetonQuest instance (which you can get using BetonQuest.getInstance() static method). The name for your event will be used in instruction strings (such as \"journal\" for journal event). The class argument is the Class object of your event. You can get it using YourEvent.class . That's it, you created an event. Don't forget to check it for bugs! Writing conditions \u00b6 Writing conditions is easy too. They must extend Condition and override execute(String playerID) method, which should return true or false , depending on if the condition was met. You register them using registerConditions(String name, Class<? extends Condition) method from BetonQuest instance as well. The rest is almost the same, you're defining the constructor which will parse the Instruction object and overriding execute(String playerID) method to check if the player meets the condition. Don't worry about inverting it, as it's automatically done by BetonQuest. Conditions are always getting an online player in the execute(String playerID) method, so you don't need to check that manually. Writing objectives \u00b6 Objectives are more complicated because they use event handlers and they must store players' data. They extend Objective class. As always, you need to extract all data from supplied Instruction object in the constructor. Don't register listeners in the constructor! If your objective handles changing data (like amount of mobs left to kill) you should create a class extending ObjectiveData . For example block objective does need to store amount of blocks left to place/break, and it does that using \"BlockData\" class. In the constructor it receives three strings: data string, ID of the player and ID of the objective. The latter two are used by BetonQuest to correctly save and load the former one from the database. The data string should contains all the information you need in your objective. You must write a parser which will extract the information, methods used in the objective to alter the information, and override the toString() method in so it returns data string in the format parsable by your parser. Everytime the data in your object changes (like when killing a mob), you need to call update() method. It will save the data to the database. Now you should override getDefaultDataInstruction() method. It must return the default data instruction understandable by your parser. For example in tame objective it will return the amount of mobs to tame. If you don't use data objects, just return an empty string (not null , just \"\" ). In order for your objective to use the data object you have created you need to set the template variable to this object's class. If you're not defining the data object (because you don't need to handle the changing data), you should set the template simply to ObjectiveData.class . Every time your objective accepts the player's action (for example killing the right mob in MobKill objective) it must be also verified with checkConditions() method. You don't want your objective ignoring all conditions, right? When you decide that the objective is completed you should call completeObjective() method. It will fire all events for you, so you don't have to do this manually. start() and stop() methods must start objective's listeners and stop them accordingly. It's because the plugin turns the objective's listeners off if there are no players having it active. Here usually you will register/unregister listeners, but some objectives may be different. For example delay objective starts and cancels a runnable, instead of using listeners. If your objective has some properties (used in variables) you should override the String getProperty(String property, String playerID) method. At runtime, if anyone uses %objective.yourObjective.theProperty% variable, BetonQuest will call that method with theProperty keyword as the first argument. Using it you should parse the data of the objective and return it as a String. If the supplied property name is incorrect or there was an error during getting the value, return an empty String and optionally log an error ( Debug.error(String message) ). Objectives are registered the same way as conditions and events, using registerObjective(String name, Class<? extends Objective>) method. Reading Instruction object \u00b6 The Instruction object parses the instruction string defined by the user and splits it into arguments. You can ask it for required arguments one by one with next() method or a parser method like getQuestItem() . Required arguments are the ones specified at the very beginning of an instruction string, for example add someTag in tag event. It will automaticly throw InstructionParseException for you if it encounters an error, for example when there were no more arguments in user's instruction or it can't parse the argument to the type you asked for. You can also ask for optional arguments: if the instruction string contains argument arg:something and you ask for optional arg , it will give you something . If there is no optional argument, it will return null . Don't worry about passing that null to parser methods like getLocation(String) , they won't throw an error, they'll simply return that null . Parser methods are there for your convenience. You could write a location parser for yourself, but there's no need for that, you can just use getLocation() or getLocation(String) method and receive LocationData object. The former method is simply getLocation(next()) . If your instruction is more complicated and Instruction class doesn't provide necessary methods, you can still parse the instruction string manually. You can get it with getInstruction() method. Just remember to throw InstructionParseException when the instruction supplied by the user is incorrect. BetonQuest will catch them and display a message in the console. Writing variables \u00b6 All variables need to extend Variable class. In the constructor you must parse the instruction and extract all information about your variable's behavior. Then you have to override the String getValue(String playerID) method. It should return the value of the variable for the supplied player. If it's impossible, it should return an empty String. Registering variables is done via BetonQuest.registerVariable(String name, Class<? extends Variable> variable) method. Firing events \u00b6 The plugin has a static method for firing events - event(String playerID, EventID eventID) . First parameter is ID of the player. Second one represents ID of the event. To get it, simply create an instance of the EventID class. You can't fire an event directly using an instruction string. Checking conditions \u00b6 BetonQuest has static boolean method condition(String playerID, String conditionID) . It works similarly as event method described above. Starting objectives \u00b6 The newObjective(String playerID, String objectiveID) method will launch the objective from start. You can however use resumeObjective(String playerID, String objectiveID, String instruction) to pass your own ObjectiveData instruction to the objective. It will not be saved to the database, because it is assumed that the objective has just been loaded from it and it exists there without any change. You should save it manually. Creating additional conversation input/output methods \u00b6 In order to register an object as the conversation input/output it needs to implement ConversationIO interface. The constructor will receive three arguments: Conversation object, playerID String and NPC name String. It needs to parse the required data here and register all needed listeners. The setResponse(String response) method will receive NPC's text from the conversation. The addOption(String option) method will be called by the conversation for each reply option for this NPC text. The object must store all this data and when display() is called, it must use it to display the player the output. When it detects that the player chose an answer, it should pass it to the conversation using Conversation.passPlayerAnswer(int number) method. The integer is the number of the answer, starting at 1. clear() method will be called at the beginning of the new conversation cycle. It should clear all the previous options, so they do not overlap. end() method will be called when the conversation ends and it should unregister all listeners. You can also call that message when you detect that the player forced conversation ending (for example by moving away from the NPC). Remember to notify the conversation about that using Conversation.end() . Registering the conversation inputs/outputs is done in the same way as objectives, events and conditions, through BetonQuest.registerConversationIO(String name, Class<? extends ConversationIO>) method. Listening to BetonQuest (Bukkit) events \u00b6 BetonQuest calls Bukkit events on a few occasions: when a conversation is started, finished and when an option is selected. You can find these events in pl.betoncraft.betonquest.api package and use them in your plugins. If you need any additional events just open and issue on GitHub or send me a pull request. Debugging \u00b6 You can debug your code using LogUtils class by simply call LogUtils.getlogger().log(..) to log something. We use the following levels for this aspects: - SEVER - Anything happen, that breaks the plugin, or a main function of the plugin - WARNING - The most things, where something not normal or unexpected happens, but the plugin still work correctly for the rest(all catch blocks, when not SEVER) - INFO - Anything you want to log, that also should appear in the normal console - CONFIG - Not in use at the moment - FINE - All messages, that you want to only appear in the debug log file, not in the console - FINER - Do not use this, this is reserved, for exception logging, like you call LogUtils.logThrowable or LogUtils.logThrowableIgnore - FINEST - Not in use at the moment If you have a catch block, please log this with a message, that calls exception.getMessage() and log the complete exception by using the Logutils.logThrowable(e) .

You need to create a class extending QuestEvent for each new event. The constructor must take one argument, an Instruction object. In the constructor you must extract all information from the instruction, for example skill names, locations etc. The description of the Instruction class is down below. Don't worry about checking event conditions, these are handled by the rest of BetonQuest's logic. Events are not bound to any player so firing it is done through fire(String playerID) method. You have to override it with your code responsible for doing stuff your event should do. Here you should use data previously parsed by the constructor. Don't access Instruction object here, it will lower the performance. You can convert playerID to Player object using the PlayerConverter class (it's a relict of times when both UUIDs and names could be used in Bukkit to identify players). If you want your event to be persistent , you need to set super.persistent variable to true in the constructor. This will make BetonQuest run this event even if the playerID points to an offline player, so prepare your code for that. If you want your event to be static , you need to set super.staticness variable to true in the constructor. This will allow BetonQuest to run this event with playerID set to null , so prepare your code for that. When you'll finish your class you need to invoke registerEvents(String name, Class<? extends QuestEvent> class) from BetonQuest instance (which you can get using BetonQuest.getInstance() static method). The name for your event will be used in instruction strings (such as \"journal\" for journal event). The class argument is the Class object of your event. You can get it using YourEvent.class . That's it, you created an event. Don't forget to check it for bugs!","title":"Writing events"},{"location":"Developer-Documentation/Info-for-developers/#writing-conditions","text":"Writing conditions is easy too. They must extend Condition and override execute(String playerID) method, which should return true or false , depending on if the condition was met. You register them using registerConditions(String name, Class<? extends Condition) method from BetonQuest instance as well. The rest is almost the same, you're defining the constructor which will parse the Instruction object and overriding execute(String playerID) method to check if the player meets the condition. Don't worry about inverting it, as it's automatically done by BetonQuest. Conditions are always getting an online player in the execute(String playerID) method, so you don't need to check that manually.","title":"Writing conditions"},{"location":"Developer-Documentation/Info-for-developers/#writing-objectives","text":"Objectives are more complicated because they use event handlers and they must store players' data. They extend Objective class. As always, you need to extract all data from supplied Instruction object in the constructor. Don't register listeners in the constructor! If your objective handles changing data (like amount of mobs left to kill) you should create a class extending ObjectiveData . For example block objective does need to store amount of blocks left to place/break, and it does that using \"BlockData\" class. In the constructor it receives three strings: data string, ID of the player and ID of the objective. The latter two are used by BetonQuest to correctly save and load the former one from the database. The data string should contains all the information you need in your objective. You must write a parser which will extract the information, methods used in the objective to alter the information, and override the toString() method in so it returns data string in the format parsable by your parser. Everytime the data in your object changes (like when killing a mob), you need to call update() method. It will save the data to the database. Now you should override getDefaultDataInstruction() method. It must return the default data instruction understandable by your parser. For example in tame objective it will return the amount of mobs to tame. If you don't use data objects, just return an empty string (not null , just \"\" ). In order for your objective to use the data object you have created you need to set the template variable to this object's class. If you're not defining the data object (because you don't need to handle the changing data), you should set the template simply to ObjectiveData.class . Every time your objective accepts the player's action (for example killing the right mob in MobKill objective) it must be also verified with checkConditions() method. You don't want your objective ignoring all conditions, right? When you decide that the objective is completed you should call completeObjective() method. It will fire all events for you, so you don't have to do this manually. start() and stop() methods must start objective's listeners and stop them accordingly. It's because the plugin turns the objective's listeners off if there are no players having it active. Here usually you will register/unregister listeners, but some objectives may be different. For example delay objective starts and cancels a runnable, instead of using listeners. If your objective has some properties (used in variables) you should override the String getProperty(String property, String playerID) method. At runtime, if anyone uses %objective.yourObjective.theProperty% variable, BetonQuest will call that method with theProperty keyword as the first argument. Using it you should parse the data of the objective and return it as a String. If the supplied property name is incorrect or there was an error during getting the value, return an empty String and optionally log an error ( Debug.error(String message) ). Objectives are registered the same way as conditions and events, using registerObjective(String name, Class<? extends Objective>) method.","title":"Writing objectives"},{"location":"Developer-Documentation/Info-for-developers/#reading-instruction-object","text":"The Instruction object parses the instruction string defined by the user and splits it into arguments. You can ask it for required arguments one by one with next() method or a parser method like getQuestItem() . Required arguments are the ones specified at the very beginning of an instruction string, for example add someTag in tag event. It will automaticly throw InstructionParseException for you if it encounters an error, for example when there were no more arguments in user's instruction or it can't parse the argument to the type you asked for. You can also ask for optional arguments: if the instruction string contains argument arg:something and you ask for optional arg , it will give you something . If there is no optional argument, it will return null . Don't worry about passing that null to parser methods like getLocation(String) , they won't throw an error, they'll simply return that null . Parser methods are there for your convenience. You could write a location parser for yourself, but there's no need for that, you can just use getLocation() or getLocation(String) method and receive LocationData object. The former method is simply getLocation(next()) . If your instruction is more complicated and Instruction class doesn't provide necessary methods, you can still parse the instruction string manually. You can get it with getInstruction() method. Just remember to throw InstructionParseException when the instruction supplied by the user is incorrect.

You can find it on it\u00b4s Spigot page . The free download is hidden in the first paragraph. Just put it in your plugins folder. If you like it consider a donation! It is not required though. You can use NPCs made from clay blocks instead, but that would be less immersive. It is strongly recommended. Now download the BetonQuest plugin, place the .jar file in your plugins folder, and start the server. BetonQuest has now generated it\u00b4s configuration files. If you want to use MySQL for data storage, then open config.yml and fill in your database information. If not, leave these fields blank, and the plugin will use SQLite instead. If you don't want to use autoupdater, disable it in configuration before restarting the server or reloading the plugin. When it is finished, reload the plugin ( /q reload ). Tweak the configuration to your liking and move on to the Quick start tutorial chapter. Understanding how the plugin works first is essential to knowing the commands and the permissions. Configuration \u00b6 The configuration of BetonQuest is done mainly in config.yml file. All options are described here. If you don't know about some aspects of BetonQuest, you can skip the explanation here. It will be repeated in the description of a specific feature. Warning Do not touch \"version\" option! It may corrupt your files! Configure MySQL or SQLite database. Fill it to use MySQL or leave it blank (or incorrect) to use SQLite. Language is just the currently used translation of the plugin. Currently there are 7 languages available: English (en), Polish (pl), German (de), French (fr), Spanish (es), Chinese (cn), Dutch (nl) and Italian (it). The update section controls the updater. It has the following settings: enabled (default true ). Enables or disables the Updater. If set to false, it is not possible to update with the updater and no version checks are executed. strategy (default MINOR ). The update strategy is more difficult to understand. Each plugin version is a number, that consists of three parts. For example 2.4.3 , the first number ( 2 in this example) is named MAYOR , the second MINOR ( 4 in this example) and the third PATCH ( 3 in this example). When we release a new version of BetonQuest we will change these numbers in a specific way. Each number has a fixed meaning. The table below shows you what's included in the update when we increase any of the three digits: Update Strategy MAYOR MINOR PATCH Bug Fixes New Features Breaking Changes You can also append _DEV to each strategy. This will download the dev builds for the corresponding version. This is not recommended for production/live servers, as devbuilds can contain bugs. automatic (default true ). If true the updater will download new Versions automatically. Otherwise, the updater will only download new versions when the update command is executed. default_journal_slot is a number of slots where the journal will appear after using /journal command. citizens_npcs_by_name sets whether NPCs from citizens2 should be identified in main.yml by their name instead of their id. max_npc_distance is the distance you need to walk away from the NPC for the conversation to end (in the case of using chat-based conversation interface). default_conversation_IO is a comma-separated list of conversation interfaces with the first valid one used. simple is a conversation in chat. tellraw is an extension to provide clickable options, and chest is a conversation in inventory window. If you want to use chest and also write the conversation to the players chat, use combined . Others, like menu are available if you have the required plugins and other plugins can add additional IO types. default_interceptor is a comma-separated list of chat interceptors with the first valid one used. simple attempts to catch chat events. packet uses protocollib to intercept packets before they reach the player. display_chat_after_conversation this will prevent all chat messages from displaying during a conversation and it will show them once it's finished. combat_delay is a delay (in seconds) the player must wait before starting a conversation after combat. notify_pullback will display a message every time the player is pulled back by the stop option in conversations (in the case of chat-based conversations). It notifies players that they are in a conversation, and the pullback is not a bug. default_package is a name of the package that should be used when a package is not specified in /q command. This is for your convenience. remove_items_after_respawn option should be turned on if \"keepInventory\" gamerule is not being used. It prevents other plugins from duplicating quest items after death. When a player dies, their quest items are removed from drops and stored in the backpack, but some plugins may try to restore all items to the player (for example WorldGuard custom flag keep-inventory). That is why BetonQuest removes the quest items that are in a player's inventory after they respawn again, to be sure they were not readded. The \"keepInventory\" gamerule, however, works differently - the items are never dropped, so they cannot be added to backpack. Removing them from the inventory would destroy them forever. Sadly, Bukkit does not allow for gamerule checking, so it is up to you to decide. Once again, if you have \"keepInventory\" gamerule true, this setting has to be false and vice versa. quest_items_unbreakable controls whether quest items can be broken by usage. This was used in the past, when unbreakable tag couldn't be added to items. Turn it off and make your quest items unbreakable by vanilla means. Sounds define what sounds will be played on these occasions: start and end refer to starting and ending conversations journal is updating journal update is played when there is a changelog file, used to draw your attention full is played when the player uses /j command but his inventory is full. List of all possible sounds can be found here . cmd_blacklist is a list of commands that can not be used while in conversation. Remember that you can only type single words (command names) here! hook controls compatibility with other plugins. You can turn off each hook here. journal controls various settings of the journal: chars_per_page is the number of characters before a page break. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. This was replaced by chars_per_line and lines_per_page and is only required if you don't like the new behaviour. chars_per_line is the number of characters before a line break. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. If this is not set, BQ will fall back on the old page wrapping behaviour configured through chars_per_page . lines_per_page is the number of lines before a new page. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. This is only required if chars_per_line is set. one_entry_per_page makes each entry take a single page. Note that it will not expand to other pages even if it overflows, so keep your entries short. reversed_order controls the chronological order of entries in the journal. By default, the entries are ordered from newest to oldest. It is reversible, but this will force players to click through many pages to get to the most recent entry. hide_date hides the date of each entry. Set it to true if you don't want this functionality. full_main_page makes the main page always take a full page. If a lot of information is being displayed, it is advised to make this true. If you use the main page only for small notifications, set it to false, so the entries can follow immediately. show_separator shows a separator between journal entries (default: true). Customize the separator in messages.yml with the key journal_separator . journal_colors controls the colors used in the journal. It takes color codes without the & character. date.day is the day number date.hour is the hour number line is the delimiter between entries text is the text of the entry conversation_colors controls the colors of the conversation. It takes color names . If you want to add a font style (bold, italic etc.) you can add it after a comma. npc is the name of the NPC player is the name of the player text is the NPC's text answer is the text of player's answer (after choosing it) number is the option number option is the text of an option date_format is the Java date format used in journal dates. It needs to have a space between the day and hour. debug is responsible for logging the plugin's activity to debug.log file in logs directory. Turning this on can slow your server down. However, if you experience any errors, turn this on and let the plugin gather the data and send logs to the developer. Note that the first run of the plugin will be logged anyway, just as a precaution. conversation_IO_config manages settings for individual conoversation IO's: chest manages settings for the chest conversation IO show_number will show the player number option if true (default: true) show_npc_text will show the npc text in every player option if true (default: true) Updating \u00b6 The update process is safe and easy. After updating to a new version (manually or automatically), configuration files and database will be automatically backed up to a zip file to prevent losing your work due to errors. Then, configuration will be converted to a new version. At the end, the localization will be updated with new languages and the changelog.txt file will be created. When you enter the server, BetonQuest will alert you about changes and ask you to read changelog.txt file located in plugin's main directory. This helps players be aware of every change made by new versions. All future versions of BetonQuest should have full compatibility with the current version of the plugin and server. This means that the plugin should work exactly the same way as it did before without bugs after updating. The changes will be visible only in configuration format or new features. (For example in 1.5 inverting conditions was done by adding --inverted argument to the instruction. It was changed to the current format (with exclamation marks before the condition name) in 1.6 version. The plugin had updated the configuration files automatically when switching to the new version. The only problem the user had was getting used to the new (better) way of negating conditions). If there were any unexpected errors during an update process, download the previous version, restore your configs from backup, and disable autoupdating feature. Don't forget to post your error so I can fix it! Backups \u00b6 Every time the plugin updates the configuration, a backup will be created. This is especially important if a development version is being used because they may be unstable. A backup can also be created manually by running /q backup command. It needs to be run from the console on an empty server because it heavily uses the database. You can find your backups in backup directory in the plugin's folder. They are .zip files containing all your configuration and database-backup.yml file, which - as the name says - is your database backup. To replace your configuration with an older backup, delete all the files (except backups and logs) and replace them with the files from .zip file. If you want your database loaded, place database-backup.yml file in plugin's directory. When the plugin sees this file while enabling, it will backup the current database and load all data from that file to the database. A backup of the old database can be found in backups folder, so if you ever need to load it back, just rename it to database-backup.yml and place it back in main plugin's directory. Note that database-backup.yml file will be deleted after loading, so it does not replace your database on next plugin start. Migrating database from SQLite to MySQL and back \u00b6 Follow these few simple steps to migrate your database easily: Create a backup with /q backup command. Extract database backup from it. Turn the server off. Place the database-backup.yml file inside the plugin's directory.

Now download the BetonQuest plugin, place the .jar file in your plugins folder, and start the server. BetonQuest has now generated it\u00b4s configuration files. If you want to use MySQL for data storage, then open config.yml and fill in your database information. If not, leave these fields blank, and the plugin will use SQLite instead. If you don't want to use autoupdater, disable it in configuration before restarting the server or reloading the plugin. When it is finished, reload the plugin ( /q reload ). Tweak the configuration to your liking and move on to the Quick start tutorial chapter. Understanding how the plugin works first is essential to knowing the commands and the permissions.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Installation-and-Configuration/#configuration","text":"The configuration of BetonQuest is done mainly in config.yml file.

Language is just the currently used translation of the plugin. Currently there are 7 languages available: English (en), Polish (pl), German (de), French (fr), Spanish (es), Chinese (cn), Dutch (nl) and Italian (it). The update section controls the updater. It has the following settings: enabled (default true ). Enables or disables the Updater. If set to false, it is not possible to update with the updater and no version checks are executed. strategy (default MINOR ). The update strategy is more difficult to understand. Each plugin version is a number, that consists of three parts. For example 2.4.3 , the first number ( 2 in this example) is named MAYOR , the second MINOR ( 4 in this example) and the third PATCH ( 3 in this example). When we release a new version of BetonQuest we will change these numbers in a specific way. Each number has a fixed meaning. The table below shows you what's included in the update when we increase any of the three digits: Update Strategy MAYOR MINOR PATCH Bug Fixes New Features Breaking Changes You can also append _DEV to each strategy. This will download the dev builds for the corresponding version. This is not recommended for production/live servers, as devbuilds can contain bugs. automatic (default true ). If true the updater will download new Versions automatically. Otherwise, the updater will only download new versions when the update command is executed. default_journal_slot is a number of slots where the journal will appear after using /journal command. citizens_npcs_by_name sets whether NPCs from citizens2 should be identified in main.yml by their name instead of their id. max_npc_distance is the distance you need to walk away from the NPC for the conversation to end (in the case of using chat-based conversation interface). default_conversation_IO is a comma-separated list of conversation interfaces with the first valid one used. simple is a conversation in chat. tellraw is an extension to provide clickable options, and chest is a conversation in inventory window. If you want to use chest and also write the conversation to the players chat, use combined . Others, like menu are available if you have the required plugins and other plugins can add additional IO types. default_interceptor is a comma-separated list of chat interceptors with the first valid one used. simple attempts to catch chat events. packet uses protocollib to intercept packets before they reach the player. display_chat_after_conversation this will prevent all chat messages from displaying during a conversation and it will show them once it's finished. combat_delay is a delay (in seconds) the player must wait before starting a conversation after combat. notify_pullback will display a message every time the player is pulled back by the stop option in conversations (in the case of chat-based conversations). It notifies players that they are in a conversation, and the pullback is not a bug. default_package is a name of the package that should be used when a package is not specified in /q command. This is for your convenience. remove_items_after_respawn option should be turned on if \"keepInventory\" gamerule is not being used. It prevents other plugins from duplicating quest items after death. When a player dies, their quest items are removed from drops and stored in the backpack, but some plugins may try to restore all items to the player (for example WorldGuard custom flag keep-inventory). That is why BetonQuest removes the quest items that are in a player's inventory after they respawn again, to be sure they were not readded. The \"keepInventory\" gamerule, however, works differently - the items are never dropped, so they cannot be added to backpack. Removing them from the inventory would destroy them forever. Sadly, Bukkit does not allow for gamerule checking, so it is up to you to decide. Once again, if you have \"keepInventory\" gamerule true, this setting has to be false and vice versa. quest_items_unbreakable controls whether quest items can be broken by usage. This was used in the past, when unbreakable tag couldn't be added to items. Turn it off and make your quest items unbreakable by vanilla means. Sounds define what sounds will be played on these occasions: start and end refer to starting and ending conversations journal is updating journal update is played when there is a changelog file, used to draw your attention full is played when the player uses /j command but his inventory is full. List of all possible sounds can be found here . cmd_blacklist is a list of commands that can not be used while in conversation. Remember that you can only type single words (command names) here! hook controls compatibility with other plugins. You can turn off each hook here. journal controls various settings of the journal: chars_per_page is the number of characters before a page break. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. This was replaced by chars_per_line and lines_per_page and is only required if you don't like the new behaviour. chars_per_line is the number of characters before a line break. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. If this is not set, BQ will fall back on the old page wrapping behaviour configured through chars_per_page . lines_per_page is the number of lines before a new page. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. This is only required if chars_per_line is set. one_entry_per_page makes each entry take a single page. Note that it will not expand to other pages even if it overflows, so keep your entries short. reversed_order controls the chronological order of entries in the journal. By default, the entries are ordered from newest to oldest. It is reversible, but this will force players to click through many pages to get to the most recent entry. hide_date hides the date of each entry. Set it to true if you don't want this functionality. full_main_page makes the main page always take a full page. If a lot of information is being displayed, it is advised to make this true. If you use the main page only for small notifications, set it to false, so the entries can follow immediately. show_separator shows a separator between journal entries (default: true). Customize the separator in messages.yml with the key journal_separator . journal_colors controls the colors used in the journal. It takes color codes without the & character. date.day is the day number date.hour is the hour number line is the delimiter between entries text is the text of the entry conversation_colors controls the colors of the conversation. It takes color names . If you want to add a font style (bold, italic etc.) you can add it after a comma. npc is the name of the NPC player is the name of the player text is the NPC's text answer is the text of player's answer (after choosing it) number is the option number option is the text of an option date_format is the Java date format used in journal dates. It needs to have a space between the day and hour. debug is responsible for logging the plugin's activity to debug.log file in logs directory. Turning this on can slow your server down. However, if you experience any errors, turn this on and let the plugin gather the data and send logs to the developer. Note that the first run of the plugin will be logged anyway, just as a precaution. conversation_IO_config manages settings for individual conoversation IO's: chest manages settings for the chest conversation IO show_number will show the player number option if true (default: true) show_npc_text will show the npc text in every player option if true (default: true)","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Installation-and-Configuration/#updating","text":"The update process is safe and easy. After updating to a new version (manually or automatically), configuration files and database will be automatically backed up to a zip file to prevent losing your work due to errors. Then, configuration will be converted to a new version. At the end, the localization will be updated with new languages and the changelog.txt file will be created. When you enter the server, BetonQuest will alert you about changes and ask you to read changelog.txt file located in plugin's main directory. This helps players be aware of every change made by new versions. All future versions of BetonQuest should have full compatibility with the current version of the plugin and server. This means that the plugin should work exactly the same way as it did before without bugs after updating. The changes will be visible only in configuration format or new features. (For example in 1.5 inverting conditions was done by adding --inverted argument to the instruction. It was changed to the current format (with exclamation marks before the condition name) in 1.6 version. The plugin had updated the configuration files automatically when switching to the new version. The only problem the user had was getting used to the new (better) way of negating conditions).

They are .zip files containing all your configuration and database-backup.yml file, which - as the name says - is your database backup. To replace your configuration with an older backup, delete all the files (except backups and logs) and replace them with the files from .zip file. If you want your database loaded, place database-backup.yml file in plugin's directory. When the plugin sees this file while enabling, it will backup the current database and load all data from that file to the database. A backup of the old database can be found in backups folder, so if you ever need to load it back, just rename it to database-backup.yml and place it back in main plugin's directory.

Checking out the \"default\" example quest. \u00b6 Let's start by checking out the build in example quest. You can find it in the BetonQuest directory that has been generated in your plugins folder. The folder you are looking for is named \" default \". Open it up and find a file called main.yml . It contains a lot of options, but you only need to look at this section: 1 2 npcs : '0' : innkeeper You will need to change the '0' to the ID of the Citizens NPC you want to learn Beton with. You obtain a NPC's ID by selecting it with /npc sel while looking at it and then running /npc id . Execute /q reload and right-click the NPC. The conversation should start. If it did not, check if you correctly assigned the ID. Ask the Innkeeper for some quests. He will tell you to cut some trees. If you want, type /journal to get the journal and see a new entry. Now, don't try to place any wood blocks. BetonQuest will detect that and increase the number of blocks to destroy. Just go and find some trees that you can cut down. Now you can return to Innkeeper and give him the wood. You will receive the reward. Using events and conditions \u00b6 Now that you know how a (very) simple quest looks like time to start learning how to write something similar. Let's start with events. We won't do conversations just now, since they heavily use events and conditions, so you need to know them first. You can read complete reference to events in the Reference chapter . Do that now or just continue with this tutorial. Events \u00b6 Let's just open events.yml file inside the default package. At the end add a new line: 1 mega : \"message Hello world!\" This is an event instruction. BetonQuest will use it to determine what type of event it is and what exactly should it do. mega is the name, message is the events type and Hello world! tells the message event what it needs to display. In this case, if you run sayHello event, it will display to you Hello world! message. Now save the file, issue /q reload command and run the event with /q e {name} mega command ( q is shortcut for quest , e is shortcut for event , {name} is your Minecraft name without the brackets and mega is the name of the event we've just created). It should show you white Hello world! message in the chat. Let's create another event, more complicated one. teleport seems complicated enough. As you can read in the Events list , it needs a single argument, the location. Press F3 and check out your current location (it's shown on the left, three numbers, x , y and z ). Now add in events.yml another line: 1 tp : \"teleport 100;200;300;world\" and replace 100 with your x coordinate, 200 with y and 300 with z . world needs to be replaced with your current world's name. Save the file, reload the plugin ( /q reload ) and run this event with a command described before. It should teleport you to the location you have specified. Congratulations, you have just created your first events. Go ahead and do some experiments with other event types. You can find them in Events list chapter. Once you're done let's start learning conditions. Conditions \u00b6 Open the conditions.yml file and add a new line: 1 mega : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" Can you see how we named the mega condition in the same way as the mega event? They are not connected in any way. Condition names and event names are separated, so you can give them the same name without any problems. Now let's look at the instruction string. As you can suspect, location is a type of the condition. This one means that we'll be checking if the player is near that location (you should change the location to the place where you're standing right now, so you don't have to run around the world). Note that at the end of location argument there is an additional number, 5 . This is the maximum distance you can be away from the location to meet the condition. Alright, save the file and reload the plugin. Now walk to the location you have defined in the condition. Try to stand on the exact block corresponding to that location. Issue /q c {name} mega command ( c is shortcut for condition ). It should show you \"checking condition blah blah blah: true \". We're focusing on that last word, true . This means that you're meeting the condition: you're standing withing 5 block radius of the location. Now move 2 blocks away and issue that command again. You should still be meeting the condition. Walk 4 more blocks away and try now. It should show false . You are now outside of that 5 block radius. Get it? Great. Now I'll show you the simplest use of those conditions. Open the events.yml file again, and at the end of mega instruction add conditions:mega argument. By the way, rename your events to something that actually fits the type of the event, otherwise it will get confusing really fast. Example: events.yml # This is a comment btw # Old: mega : \"message Hello world!\" # New: sayHello : \"message Hello world! conditions:isAtSpawn\" conditions.yml # Old: mega : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" # New: isAtSpawn : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" Now sayHello event will run only if it meets isAtSpawn condition. Reload the plugin, walk outside of the 5 block radius and try to run sayHello event. Puff, nothing happens. It's because you're not meeting isAtSpawn condition. Walk into the radius again and try to run that event now. It should happily display the Hello world! message. It's very nice that we can add such conditions, but the problem is: what if you wanted to display the message only if the player is outside the radius? Don't worry, you don't have to specify inverted_location condition or anything like that. You can simply negate the condition. Negation makes the condition behave in the exact opposite way, in this case it isAtSpawn will be met only if the player is outside of the 5 block radius, and it won't be met if he's inside. Open the events.yml and add an exclamation mark before the isAtSpawn condition, so it looks like this: 1 sayHello : \"message Hello world! conditions:!isAtSpawn\" This means \"display message Hello world! if the isAtSpawn condition is not met \". Save the file, reload the plugin and run the event inside and outside of the radius to see how it works. Basic tags \u00b6 Now that you know how to use events and conditions I'll show you what tags are. Create new events: 1 2 add_beton_tag : \"tag add beton\" del_beton_tag : \"tag del beton\" It's a good practice to give your events names that describe what they are doing. Imagine you have 100 events, foo24 , bar65 , baz12 etc. You would get lost pretty quickly. So, add_beton_tag event here simply adds beton tag to the player, del_beton_tag removes it. Save the file, reload the plugin and run this event. Nothing happens... or does it? Issue /q t {name} command ( t is shortcut for tags ). It should show you a list with few entries. Right now focus on default.beton , the rest are used by the default quest for Innkeeper. Alright, default is the name of the package in which the tag is, and beton is the name of the tag, as defined in add_beton_tag event. Now run del_beton_tag event. Guess what, default.beton disappeared from the list! And that's it, you know how to add and remove tags. Pretty useless. Nothing could be more wrong. Tags are one the most powerful things in BetonQuest. They just need to be used with tag condition. Open conditions.yml and add 1 has_beton_tag : \"tag beton\" line. As you can imagine, tag is the type of condition (the same as tag event, but these are not the same things - one is an event, the other one is a condition) and beton is the name of the tag. You don't have to specify default.beton , but you can if you want. Now save, reload and check it with a command. It should show false , since you have removed the tag with del_beton_tag event. Add it again with add_beton_tag event and check the has_beton_tag condition again. Now it will show true . Now you probably understand how powerful this system is. You could for example set a tag on the first time the player talks with an NPC, and if the NPC sees that tag next time they talk, he will tell something different, like \"welcome back\". Creating objectives \u00b6 Time to write some objectives! Open the objectives.yml file and add a new line: 1 kill_creepers : \"mobkill CREEPER 3 events:bar conditions:has_beton_tag\" Now let's analyze it. kill_creepers is a name of the objective. mobkill is a type. In this case, to complete the objective the player will have to kill some mobs. creeper is a type of the mob, so we know that these mobs will have to be Creepers. 3 is the amount. It means that the player has to kill 3 Creepers. events:bar means than once the player kills those Creepers, the bar event will be run (it's the teleportation event). conditions:has_beton_tag tells us that the player will have to have beton tag while killing Creepers to complete the objective. Save it, reload the plugin and issue /q o {name} add kill_creepers command ( o is for objective , add tells the plugin to add an objective). Now you can check if you actually have this objective with /q o {name} command, it will show you all your active objectives. It should show default.kill_creepers . Alright, remove (yes, remove!) the beton tag from you and find some Creepers to kill. Once you killes 3 of them you will notice that nothing happened. It's because has_beton_tag condtion is not met, so the objective does not count your progress. Now add the tag again and kill another Creepers. When the third is dead you should be teleported to the location defined in bar event. Congratulations, now you know how to use objectives. You should experiment with other types now, since objectives will be used very often in your quests. Once you're done check out the Writing your first conversation chapter to use your knowledge to write your fisrt conversation. Writing your first conversation \u00b6 Now that you have seen BetonQuest in action and understood events, conditions and objectives, it's time for writing your first conversation. There's a conversations directory inside the default package. It contains a single file, innkeeper.yml . This is the conversation with Innkeeper, the one who asks you to cut some trees. Open it, we'll use that for reference. Now create a new file, let's say miner.yml . Now type (don't copy-paste it, you'll learn better while typing) that into the file: 1 2 3 4 5 quester : Miner first : greeting NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! It's the most basic conversation possible. The NPC named Miner upon starting the conversation will use greeting option, which means he will say Hi there, traveler! . Then the conversation will end, because there are no player options defined. Now you need to link the conversation with an NPC. You do that in the main.yml file. Open it now. As you can see, conversation is linked to Innkeeper word. It's the one you have put on the sign, remember? Now, add another line under the Innkeeper: Miner: miner.yml , save the file and reload the server. This will link our new conversation with the NPC named \"Miner\". Construct a new NPC on the server, give him a sign with \"Miner\" name and click on the head. Guess what, the conversation finished right after it started. The Miner just said Hi there, traveler! , as expected. Now go to the conversation file and edit it (again, manually, no copy-paste!) so the options look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello, bye player_options : hello : text : Hello! bye : text : I need to go, sorry. When you save the file, reload the plugin and start the conversation again you will notice that there are two options for you to choose: Hello! and I need to go, sorry. Choosing any of them will end the conversation, because these options did not specify any pointers. Now add a new NPC option, for example weather with text Nice weather. and make hello player option point to it. When you save&reload, the Miner should say Nice weather. when you tell him Hello! . I think you get how it works. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello, bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now, every time you talk to the Miner, he will say the same thing. It would be nice if the second time you talk to him he knew your name. We can do that with tags. Define a meet_miner event and has_met_miner condition. When you talk to the Miner for the first time, he will check if you have met him. If not, he will meet you (with that event) and next time you talk, the condition will be passed and he will use your name. Now, rename greeting NPC option to first_greeting . Add meet_miner event and negated has_met_miner condition (negated because this option should only show if the player has not met the Miner yet). You will need to surround the condition with '' , because strings cannot start with exclamation marks in YAML. It should look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 first : first_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello, bye This means: first_greeting should be used if the player does not pass has_met_miner condition (meaning he doesn't have a tag because he haven't talked to the NPC yet). When this option is used, it will fire meet_miner event and display hello and bye options. Alright, but what happens if the player met the Miner and now negated has_met_miner condition doesn't work? NPC will try to use next option defined in first setting. There is none yet, so let's add it. 1 2 3 4 5 first : first_greeting, regular_greeting NPC_options : regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello, bye This option does not have any conditions, so if the first_greeting fails, the NPC will always choose this one. Now take a look at the %player% thing. It's a variable. In this place it will show your name. There are more than this one, they are described in Reference chapter. Alright, save&reload and start the conversation. If you did everything correctly, the Miner should greet you as a \"traveler\", and the second time you talk to him, he should greet you with your Minecraft name. Here's the whole conversation you created, so you can check if you understood everything correctly: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 first : first_greeting, regular_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello, bye regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello, bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now you should experiment some more with this conversation, you can help yourself by looking at the innkeeper.yml file. Try to understand how that conversation works step by step. As the excercise you should complete the Miner NPC, so he asks you to mine some iron ore, then smelt it in the furnace, next craft an armor with it and return to him wearing this armor. You might want to check out the Reference chapter to see how to handle items in your quests and how to add entries to the journal. If you want to use Citizens NPCs instead of the ones made with clay you will find information you need in that chapter too. To find out more about events, conditions, objectives and variables, take a look at the appropriate lists (after the Reference chapter).","title":"Quick start tutorial"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Quick-start-tutorial/#checking-out-the-default-example-quest","text":"Let's start by checking out the build in example quest.

This means that you're meeting the condition: you're standing withing 5 block radius of the location. Now move 2 blocks away and issue that command again. You should still be meeting the condition. Walk 4 more blocks away and try now. It should show false . You are now outside of that 5 block radius. Get it? Great. Now I'll show you the simplest use of those conditions. Open the events.yml file again, and at the end of mega instruction add conditions:mega argument. By the way, rename your events to something that actually fits the type of the event, otherwise it will get confusing really fast. Example: events.yml # This is a comment btw # Old: mega : \"message Hello world!\" # New: sayHello : \"message Hello world! conditions:isAtSpawn\" conditions.yml # Old: mega : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" # New: isAtSpawn : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" Now sayHello event will run only if it meets isAtSpawn condition. Reload the plugin, walk outside of the 5 block radius and try to run sayHello event. Puff, nothing happens. It's because you're not meeting isAtSpawn condition. Walk into the radius again and try to run that event now. It should happily display the Hello world! message. It's very nice that we can add such conditions, but the problem is: what if you wanted to display the message only if the player is outside the radius? Don't worry, you don't have to specify inverted_location condition or anything like that. You can simply negate the condition. Negation makes the condition behave in the exact opposite way, in this case it isAtSpawn will be met only if the player is outside of the 5 block radius, and it won't be met if he's inside. Open the events.yml and add an exclamation mark before the isAtSpawn condition, so it looks like this: 1 sayHello : \"message Hello world! conditions:!isAtSpawn\" This means \"display message Hello world! if the isAtSpawn condition is not met \". Save the file, reload the plugin and run the event inside and outside of the radius to see how it works.","title":"Conditions"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Quick-start-tutorial/#basic-tags","text":"Now that you know how to use events and conditions I'll show you what tags are. Create new events: 1 2 add_beton_tag : \"tag add beton\" del_beton_tag : \"tag del beton\" It's a good practice to give your events names that describe what they are doing. Imagine you have 100 events, foo24 , bar65 , baz12 etc. You would get lost pretty quickly. So, add_beton_tag event here simply adds beton tag to the player, del_beton_tag removes it. Save the file, reload the plugin and run this event. Nothing happens... or does it? Issue /q t {name} command ( t is shortcut for tags ). It should show you a list with few entries. Right now focus on default.beton , the rest are used by the default quest for Innkeeper. Alright, default is the name of the package in which the tag is, and beton is the name of the tag, as defined in add_beton_tag event. Now run del_beton_tag event. Guess what, default.beton disappeared from the list! And that's it, you know how to add and remove tags. Pretty useless. Nothing could be more wrong. Tags are one the most powerful things in BetonQuest. They just need to be used with tag condition. Open conditions.yml and add 1 has_beton_tag : \"tag beton\" line. As you can imagine, tag is the type of condition (the same as tag event, but these are not the same things - one is an event, the other one is a condition) and beton is the name of the tag. You don't have to specify default.beton , but you can if you want. Now save, reload and check it with a command. It should show false , since you have removed the tag with del_beton_tag event. Add it again with add_beton_tag event and check the has_beton_tag condition again. Now it will show true . Now you probably understand how powerful this system is. You could for example set a tag on the first time the player talks with an NPC, and if the NPC sees that tag next time they talk, he will tell something different, like \"welcome back\".","title":"Basic tags"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Quick-start-tutorial/#creating-objectives","text":"Time to write some objectives! Open the objectives.yml file and add a new line: 1 kill_creepers : \"mobkill CREEPER 3 events:bar conditions:has_beton_tag\" Now let's analyze it. kill_creepers is a name of the objective. mobkill is a type. In this case, to complete the objective the player will have to kill some mobs. creeper is a type of the mob, so we know that these mobs will have to be Creepers. 3 is the amount. It means that the player has to kill 3 Creepers. events:bar means than once the player kills those Creepers, the bar event will be run (it's the teleportation event). conditions:has_beton_tag tells us that the player will have to have beton tag while killing Creepers to complete the objective. Save it, reload the plugin and issue /q o {name} add kill_creepers command ( o is for objective , add tells the plugin to add an objective). Now you can check if you actually have this objective with /q o {name} command, it will show you all your active objectives. It should show default.kill_creepers . Alright, remove (yes, remove!) the beton tag from you and find some Creepers to kill. Once you killes 3 of them you will notice that nothing happened. It's because has_beton_tag condtion is not met, so the objective does not count your progress. Now add the tag again and kill another Creepers. When the third is dead you should be teleported to the location defined in bar event. Congratulations, now you know how to use objectives. You should experiment with other types now, since objectives will be used very often in your quests. Once you're done check out the Writing your first conversation chapter to use your knowledge to write your fisrt conversation.","title":"Creating objectives"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Quick-start-tutorial/#writing-your-first-conversation","text":"Now that you have seen BetonQuest in action and understood events, conditions and objectives, it's time for writing your first conversation. There's a conversations directory inside the default package. It contains a single file, innkeeper.yml . This is the conversation with Innkeeper, the one who asks you to cut some trees. Open it, we'll use that for reference. Now create a new file, let's say miner.yml . Now type (don't copy-paste it, you'll learn better while typing) that into the file: 1 2 3 4 5 quester : Miner first : greeting NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! It's the most basic conversation possible. The NPC named Miner upon starting the conversation will use greeting option, which means he will say Hi there, traveler! . Then the conversation will end, because there are no player options defined. Now you need to link the conversation with an NPC. You do that in the main.yml file. Open it now. As you can see, conversation is linked to Innkeeper word. It's the one you have put on the sign, remember? Now, add another line under the Innkeeper: Miner: miner.yml , save the file and reload the server. This will link our new conversation with the NPC named \"Miner\". Construct a new NPC on the server, give him a sign with \"Miner\" name and click on the head. Guess what, the conversation finished right after it started. The Miner just said Hi there, traveler! , as expected. Now go to the conversation file and edit it (again, manually, no copy-paste!) so the options look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello, bye player_options : hello : text : Hello! bye : text : I need to go, sorry. When you save the file, reload the plugin and start the conversation again you will notice that there are two options for you to choose: Hello! and I need to go, sorry. Choosing any of them will end the conversation, because these options did not specify any pointers. Now add a new NPC option, for example weather with text Nice weather. and make hello player option point to it. When you save&reload, the Miner should say Nice weather. when you tell him Hello! . I think you get how it works. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello, bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now, every time you talk to the Miner, he will say the same thing. It would be nice if the second time you talk to him he knew your name. We can do that with tags. Define a meet_miner event and has_met_miner condition. When you talk to the Miner for the first time, he will check if you have met him. If not, he will meet you (with that event) and next time you talk, the condition will be passed and he will use your name. Now, rename greeting NPC option to first_greeting . Add meet_miner event and negated has_met_miner condition (negated because this option should only show if the player has not met the Miner yet). You will need to surround the condition with '' , because strings cannot start with exclamation marks in YAML. It should look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 first : first_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello, bye This means: first_greeting should be used if the player does not pass has_met_miner condition (meaning he doesn't have a tag because he haven't talked to the NPC yet). When this option is used, it will fire meet_miner event and display hello and bye options. Alright, but what happens if the player met the Miner and now negated has_met_miner condition doesn't work? NPC will try to use next option defined in first setting. There is none yet, so let's add it. 1 2 3 4 5 first : first_greeting, regular_greeting NPC_options : regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello, bye This option does not have any conditions, so if the first_greeting fails, the NPC will always choose this one. Now take a look at the %player% thing. It's a variable. In this place it will show your name. There are more than this one, they are described in Reference chapter. Alright, save&reload and start the conversation. If you did everything correctly, the Miner should greet you as a \"traveler\", and the second time you talk to him, he should greet you with your Minecraft name. Here's the whole conversation you created, so you can check if you understood everything correctly: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 first : first_greeting, regular_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello, bye regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello, bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now you should experiment some more with this conversation, you can help yourself by looking at the innkeeper.yml file. Try to understand how that conversation works step by step. As the excercise you should complete the Miner NPC, so he asks you to mine some iron ore, then smelt it in the furnace, next craft an armor with it and return to him wearing this armor. You might want to check out the Reference chapter to see how to handle items in your quests and how to add entries to the journal. If you want to use Citizens NPCs instead of the ones made with clay you will find information you need in that chapter too. To find out more about events, conditions, objectives and variables, take a look at the appropriate lists (after the Reference chapter).","title":"Writing your first conversation"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Tips-and-tricks/","text":"Tips and tricks \u00b6 Handling death in your quests \u00b6 Sometimes, while writing a dangerous quest you will want something specific to happen when the player dies. If it's a boss battle you may want to fail the quest, if it's a dungeon you may want to respawn the player at the beginning of a level etc. You can do that with die objective - simply start it for the player at the beginning of the quest and make it fire events that will do the thing you want (like teleporting the player to desired respawn point, removing tags set during the quest etc). You can add persistent argument to the objective instruction string to make it active even after completing it. Remember to delete it after the quest is done! Creating regions for one player at the time \u00b6 Imagine you have a room to which the player is teleported. Then suddenly mobs start to spawn and the player must kill them (because it's a trap or something). The player has killed all the mobs, he got a tag and wants to proceed but all of the sudden another player teleports into the room and all the mobs start to spawn again. The first player is quickly killed and the second one easily kills all mobs. You can prevent such situations by using party condition. Just check with it if the party consisting of \"players inside the room\" has greater amount of players that 1. Set the range to something big enough so it covers the room and the party condition can be tag or location. Racing with folder event \u00b6 Since folder event can run tag events even for offline players you can create races. Create location objective where you want the finish line to be and condition it with negated \"race_failed\" tag (or similar). It will mean that \"if the player has not failed the race, he can win it by reaching the location\". Now when the race starts fire folder event with the amount of time you want to give your players to complete the race. This event should set \"race_failed\" tag. If the player reaches the location before this tag is set, he will fire all events in that location objective, but if the time has passed, the objective will not be completed. You can figure the rest out for yourself. Random daily quests \u00b6 Starting the random quest must be blocked with a special tag. If there is no such tag, the conversation option should appear. Create a few quests, each of them started with single folder event (they must be started by single event!). Now add those events to another folder event and make it random:1 . At the end of every quest add delay which will reset the special blocking tag. Now add that folder event to the conversation option. When the player chooses it he will start one random quest, and the conversation option will become available after defined in delay objective time after completing the quest. Each day different quest (same for every player) \u00b6 To do this use something called \" Static event \". Using the static event run folder event every day at some late hour (for example 4am). The folder event should be random:1 and contain several different setblock events. These events will set some specific block to several different material types (for example dirt, stone, wood, sand etc). Now when the player starts the conversation and asks about the daily quest the NPC should check (using testforblock condition) which type of block is currently set and give the player different quest, depending on the block type. Make the NPC react randomly \u00b6 Imagine you want to lie to NPC and he has 15% chance of believing you completely, 35% of being suspicious and 50% of not believing at all. The common denominator for those percentages is 20, so we can write it as 3/20, 7/20 and 10/20. The NPC will check options one after another until it finds one which meets all conditions. We will use random condition with our options. The first one will have 3-20 chance (that's the format used by random condition). If this condition fails, the NPC will check next option. But it won't be 7-20 , because we already \"used\" 3 of 20. If you wrote it like that, the chance would be too low. That's why it will be 7-17 . The third option should have 10-10 (because 17 - 7 = 10 and 50% is 10/20), but as you can see it will always be true. It's because we want the last option to be shown if both previous fail. You don't have to add the last condition at all. Quest GUI \u00b6 If you want your players to be able to choose a quest everywhere, every time, then you can create a conversation which can be started with an item. This one is a little hacky but it shows flexibility of BetonQuest. First you need a conversation which behaves as a quest choosing GUI. Name the NPC \"Quester\", add one option for each quest etc. Now you need an objective which will start this conversation using conversation event. It should be action objective, set to right click on any block. Add hand condition to make it accept only clicks with a specific item and make the objective persistent (so players can use it multiple times). The item used here should be marked as Quest Item so players can't drop it. Now define new global location covering your whole map and using it start the objective and give players the item. This way all players (existing and new) will get the quest item, which opens a GUI with quests when right clicked.","title":"Tips and tricks"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Tips-and-tricks/#tips-and-tricks","text":"","title":"Tips and tricks"},{"location":"Learn-Beton/Tips-and-tricks/#handling-death-in-your-quests","text":"Sometimes, while writing a dangerous quest you will want something specific to happen when the player dies.

I'm sorry for that. Ask devs to update these plugins. - The error reporting feature was improved. If you see a lot of error messages when reloading the plugin (not stack traces, just regular, human-readable messages), it's probably because there are real problems in your quests. - BetonQuest won't accept \".yml\" extensions at the end of conversation names in \"main.yml\".

Empty files can be deleted Custom settings (i.e. EffectLib particle effects) are moved from \"main.yml\" to \"custom.yml\" Added \u00b6 Compatibility with Shopkeepers ('shopkeeper' event, 'shopamount' condition) Compatibility with PlaceholderAPI ('ph' variable and 'betonquest' placeholder) Compatibility with HolographicDisplays (holograms visible based on conditions) Compatibility with RacesAndClasses (race, class, exp, level, mana conditions/events/variables) Compatibility with LegendQuest (race, class, attribute, karma conditions/variables) Compatibility with WorldEdit ('paste' a schematic event) New condition 'riding' - check if the player is riding an entity New condition 'world' - check the world in which the player is New condition 'gamemode' - check player's game mode New condition 'achievement' - check if the player has an achievement New condition 'variable' - check if a variable matches a pattern New event 'lever' - switches a lever New event 'door' - opens/closes doors, trapdoors and gates New event 'if' - run one of two events, depending on condition New event 'movenpc' - move Citizens NPC to a location New event 'variable' - set a variable in \"variable\" objective New objective 'vehicle' - entering a vehicle entity New objective 'variable' - lets players define their own variables for you to use New objective 'kill' - kill players who meet specified conditions New objective 'breed' - breed animals (only 1.10.2+) New variable '%location%' - resolves to player's location Keyword \"unbreakable\" can be used in items to make them unbreakable When a conversation option is selected, a Bukkit event is called (for developers) Chat can be paused while in conversation, it will display when finished Objectives can be completed for players with \"/q objective player complete\" Option 'full_main_page' controls if the main page is a separate page in the journal Mobs spawned with 'spawn' can be \"marked\"; you can require marked mobs in 'mobkill' objective Firework support in items Relative package paths, where '_' means \"one package up\" [1.8.5] - 2016-05-14 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Objectives are now correctly deleted with \"objective delete\" event and do notreappear after \"/q reload\". Objectives are no longer duplicated in the database when using \"/q reload\". [1.8.4] - 2016-05-06 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Conversations are no longer started twice [1.8.3] - 2016-05-06 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Events are no longer run in async thread when completing \"password\" objective Replaced stacktrace with error message when objective is incorrect in \"objective\" event Made color codes work with \"one_entry_per_page\" setting enabled Fixed a bug where taken backpack items were not removed from the database Quest items can now be equipped \"die\" objective now correctly handles damage done to the player Fixed error when conversation is started without any possible options Fixed error when killing NPCs with equipment Fixed problems with relogging while in conversations with \"stop\" option enabled Fixed error when loading corrupted item from the database Changes \u00b6 Updater is now based on GitHub Releases, no longer downloads major updates automatically, it is more configurable and can also download development versions with \"/q update --dev\" Added \u00b6 Added console message about the cause of \"/q give\" errors (tells you what is wrong with item instruction string) [1.8.2] - 2016-02-18 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Fixed NPE when killing a mob without any \"mobkill\" objectives [1.8.1] - 2016-02-18 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Removing journal entries from the database now works correctly MobKill objective now correctly handles kills Nested package names are now correctly resolved The formatting at the end of every main page line is reset Fixed Apache dependency problem Material name is no longer displayed in \"chest\" GUI conversations Fixed \"notify\" option in give/take events [1.8] - 2016-02-13 \u00b6 Notes: - As always in big updates, compatibility with plugins hooking into BetonQuest is broken. You need to check if everything is working. Fixed \u00b6 Die objective now reacts to death caused by other plugins Static events now are started correctly Static events now are canceled correctly Action objective now correctly checks locations Combat tag is removed after death Block, Craft and MythicMobs MobKill objectives now correctly save data Take event now correctly takes items from inventory, armor slots and backpack Added \u00b6 New variable system in conversations (check out the documentation) More options for journal, including one entry per page and removing date Compatibility with mcMMO (level condition and experience event) Compatibility with EffectLib ('particle' event, NPC particles) Compatibility with PlayerPoints (points event and condition) Compatibility with Heroes (class and skill condition, experience event, Heroes kills in 'mobkill' objective) Compatibility with Magic ('wand' condition) Compatibility with Denizen (running task scripts with 'script' event) Compatibility with SkillAPI (class and level condition) Compatibility with Quests (checking for done quests, starting them, custom event reward, custom condition requirement) Optional prefix for conversations (contributed by Jack McKalling) Optional material for buttons in \"chest\" conversation IO Configurable main page in the journal New argument in objectives: \"persistent\" - makes them repeat after completing New condition 'check' - allows for specifying multiple instructions in one New condition 'objective' - checks if the player has an active objective New condition 'score' - check scores on scoreboards New condition 'chestitem' - checks if a chest contains items New event 'run' - allows for specifying multiple instructions in one New event 'givejournal' - gives journal to the player New event 'sudo' - forces the player to run a command New event 'compass' - point player's compass to a location New event 'cancel' - cancels a quest (as in main.yml) New event 'score' - modify scores on scoreboards New events 'chestgive', 'chesttake' and 'chestclear' - put and remove items in chests New objective 'logout' - the player needs to leave the server New objective 'password' - the player needs to type the password in the chat New objective 'fish' - catching fish New objective 'enchant' - enchanting an item New objective 'shear' - shearing a sheep New objective 'chestput' - putting items in a chest New objective 'potion' - brewing a potion New commands: /cancelquest and /compass - directly open backpack sub-pages New subcommand '/q delete' - delete all specific tags/points/objectives/entries New subcommand '/q rename' - rename all specific tags/points/objectives/entries New subcommand '/q give' - gives you an item from items.yml Changes \u00b6 Administrative messages are now English-only in new installations Journal event can remove entries from the journal In conversations, %quester% variable changed to %npc% In inventory GUI there is NPC's text in every option, for convenience Conversations can point to NPC options in other conversations within the package You can use spaces between events, conditions and pointers in conversations All tags and points are internally associated with a package now Some conditions are now static and persistent (just like events) Point event can now multiply points Vault Money event can now multiply money Journal event can now use \"update\" argument for updating variables on the main page Packages can now be moved to another directories Quest cancelers are now defined in a more convenient way /q command renamed to /betonquest, /j to /journal; previous forms are now aliases Conditions and events in objective instructions (and conditions in event instructions) can now be defined with \"condition:\" and \"event:\" argument (without \"s\" at the end) [1.7.6] - 2015-10-17 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Conversation can no longer be started multiple times at once if it happens on the same tick Added \u00b6 Dutch translation by Jack McKalling [1.7.5] - 2015-09-12 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Restored compatibility with MythicMobs 2.1.0 [1.7.4] - 2015-08-29 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Fixed error when player was quitting with active \"stop\" conversation while he had not changed his language with /ql command Changes \u00b6 Inventory GUI will close itself if there's nothing left to display [1.7.3] - 2015-08-20 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Combat tagging does not work if the attack has been canceled Changes \u00b6 Options in conversation can also be defined using \"event:\", \"condition:\" and \"pointers:\" argument names (with and without 's' at the end). \"text:\" argument is unchanged. [1.7.2] - 2015-07-27 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 \"mobkill\" objective now displays correct amount of mobs left to kill \"delay\" objective can be set to 0 delay [1.7.1] - 2015-07-19 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 Quests are loaded after other plugins register their types Journal condition correctly resolves package names Changes \u00b6 Updated French translation [1.7] - 2015-07-17 \u00b6 Notes: - BetonQuest no longer supports servers without UUID handling - There were a lot of changes since previous version, check carefully if everything is working - Compatibility with plugins hooking INTO BetonQuest is broken, they need to update Fixed \u00b6 Objectives no longer mysteriously double events Greatly improved performance in almost every aspect Finally fixed issues with special characters on some servers Fixed database saving/loading issues Fixed player options in conversations being white on next lines when using tellraw Added \u00b6 Quest canceling system New inventory GUI for conversations Added the \"random\" parameter in \"folder\" event - choose randomly X events to fire Action objective can be \"canceled\" - the click will not do anything Added \"static events\" mechanism for firing events at specified time of the day Optional message when the player is pulled back by stop option Optional message for take and give events Optional message when advancing in \"block\" and \"mobkill\" objectives Variable system for quick changing quest parameters (for example location of a quest) \"/q vector\" command for easy calculating location vector variables New \"empty\" condition - amount of empty inventory slots New \"party\" condition - manages the conditions in the party New \"monsters\" condition - true if there are monsters in the area New \"clear\" event - kills specified monsters in the area New \"region\" objective - reach WorldGuard region Blacklist of commands which cannot be used while in conversation Option to disable compatibility with other plugins Added remove_items_after_respawn option - for servers using keepInventory gamerule Changes \u00b6 The plugin now uses package system: configuration has been moved into \"default\" package Objectives has returned to \"objectives.yml\" - it's improving performance The database is now updated in real time All quests can (but don't have to) be translated into multiple languages Players can change their language with /questlang command Conversations with stop option are resumed when the player logs out and in again Metrics are now toggled in PluginMetrics/config.yml All conditions, events, objectives, conversations etc. are loaded when the plugin starts/reloads Citizens NPC will stop when talked to Quest blocks cannot be placed, quest items will not break Conversations cannot be started while in combat Cannot fight while in conversation Tellraw conversations no longer spam the console Mobs can be spawned with a name (spawnmob event, \"name:\" argument) /q command is now more beautiful Removed unnecessary argument prefixes from conditions and events Removed \"tag:\" from objective instruction strings Conversations no longer need those empty lines everywhere ('') Dependencies updated: WorldGuard/WorldEdit 6.1, MythicMobs 2.0.4 [1.6.2] - 2015-04-10 \u00b6 Fixed errors on data loading when MySQL is being used.

[1.6.1] - 2015-03-26 \u00b6 Fixed errors on updating journals when using MySQL. [1.6] - 2015-03-16 \u00b6 Notes: - There is a bug/feature in 1.8 which adds '\u00a70' at the end of every line in books generated by plugins. This breaks the conditions/events based on books with more than one line of text. The detailed instruction on how to work it around is in \"Other important stuff\" chapter, in the part about items. Fixed \u00b6 Items given by event that don't fit in the inventory will now drop instead of being deleted This does not apply to quest items, they will be added to backpack Events fired from conversations won't throw async errors Conversation can be started after plugin's reload without relogging /q reload no longer lags the server Corrected description in /q command Added input validation for global locations - if event is incorrect it will display an error instead of breaking the whole functionality The plugin should run fine on machines not supporting some special characters Inverted item condition now behave correctly Time condition now checks time correctly Added \u00b6 Added backpack for storing quest items, which cannot be dropped in any way Added database backups Added prefix for the database. New installations will use \"betonquest_\" prefix for tables, existing configuration will use empty prefix to maintain compatibility with other programs Players can chat while in conversations by prefixing their messages with '#' character New \"random\" condition - true with specified probability New \"sneak\" condition - true if player is sneaking New \"journal\" condition - true if player has journal entry New \"testforblock\" condition - true if block at given location matches given material New \"arrow\" objective - completed when arrow hits the specified target New \"experience\" objective - completed when player reaches certain level New \"npcinteract\" objective - completed when player right-clicks Citizens NPC New \"damage\" event - damages the player Skript support (event, effect and condition) WorldGuard support (region condition) Errors are logged to the \"error.log\" file in \"logs\" directory Debug option in config.yml for logging plugin's activity to \"debug.log\" file New commands for opening backpack: b, bb, backpack, bbackpack or betonbackpack Items are now aware of leather armor color, head owner and enchantments in books Changes \u00b6 Added and changed a lot of subcommands in /q command: event and condition can be run for every online player tag, point, objective and (new) journal can edit every (even offline) player config (new) can set configuration files from command line backup (new) backups the whole configuration and database Folder event now runs these events even after the player logs out: command, tag, objective, delete, point, setblock Changed /j command to open the backpack instead of just giving the journal Tellraw clicking on options in conversation now ignores old (used) options Using color codes in journal entries is now possible Give/take events and item condition can now check for multiple items with syntax 'give stick:2,stone:4,sword' Give/take events and item/hand conditions can now check for items only without enchantments/effects/name/lore etc. Inverting condition is now done by prefixing their name with \"!\" (in the place where you use them, like conversation, not in conditions.yml) Configuration updater is no longer based on plugin's version Backup files are now kept in \"backups\" directory, old ones are moved to it Changed internal structure of the code (may matter to developers - QuestEvent, Condition and Objective classes has been moved from \"core\" package to \"api\", update your imports) [1.5.4] - 2015-03-12 \u00b6 This version is almost the same as 1.5.3. The only difference is that it can load database backups created by 1.6 version. When updating to 1.6, the database format will change, so it won't be possible to go back, unless by loading the backup using this version of the plugin. [1.5.3] - 2014-12-26 \u00b6 Small fix of /q purge command not working on offline players. [1.5.2] - 2014-12-23 \u00b6 Fixed errors that were spamming the console when a player with active Location objective was teleporting to other worlds. [1.5.1] - 2014-12-22 \u00b6 Changes \u00b6 Multiple tags in one event are now possible Change /q event command to run from console Add color codes to item's name and lore Fix \"stop\" option in conversations not working Fix NPE on unknown answer in conversations [1.5] - 2014-12-21 \u00b6 Changes \u00b6 Added support for MythicMobs and Vault (see wiki for more info) AutoUpdater is now enabled by default! If you want you can change this and reload the plugin, nothing will be downloaded in that case Books saving format has changed. All books were automatically converted, but you need to check them if everything looks like it's supposed to. Command event accepts multiple commands separated by \"|\", eg. \"command say beton|say quest\" Event command now accepts optional argument at the end; this will fire event for player. eg. \"/q event wood_reward Steve\" Journal title and lore can now use colors (&4 etc.) and journal is colorful; options in config.yml Added aliases for /q command: bq, bquest, bquests, betonquest, betonquests, quest, quests Added aliases for /j command: bj, journal, bjournal, betonjournal Objectives are now defined directly in event instruction, not in objectives.yml (which was deleted, if you want to restore something check the backup) Replies in conversations are now optionally clickable (tellraw option in config.yml) Added permission for starting a conversation: betonquest.conversation Conversation starting/ending, updating journal, plugin's update and full inventory can now make sounds; you can find a list of possible values here: jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Sound.html Conditions for events are now defined as 'event_conditions:' instead of simply 'conditions:'. This is to distinguish conditions for objectives and for events, as both of them can exist in one instruction Updater is now run when disabling the plugin (it does matter if your server restarts every night) Notes: All Objective events has been converted to new format. The objectives.yml file has been deleted, so if it contained any objectives that weren't covered by an event they may seem lost. However there is a backup file and you can easily extract everything from it. Please refer to the wiki to learn how objectives are now defined or just study converted ones (it's pretty straightforward). AutoUpdater is now enabled by default. Every future update will be working exactly like before, all changes will be automatically updated by a converter, there is always a backup and you are informed about all changes in this file. So it's pretty safe to say that keeping this plugin up to date won't give you any trouble. If you don't want to have latest fixes and features you can disable updating but this will make the developer sad. Because of changes in how books behave since 1.8 you may experience some strange bugs with saving books to items.yml. Generally you should open a book before saving it using /q item command. And don't start or end your books with \" character, as it's part of a workaround of this bug/feature. [1.4.3] - 2014-12-15 \u00b6 Removed debug messages from ActionObjective. You could have told me, any of you guys... [1.4.2] - 2014-12-09 \u00b6 Really fixed an updater. [1.4.1] - 2014-12-09 \u00b6 Fixed few bugs in Action objective. Fixed updater, hopefully. [1.4] - 2014-12-07 \u00b6 Changes \u00b6 Conversations are now divided into multiple files in \"conversations\" directory Items are now saved to items.yml file and referenced by \"take\", \"give\", \"item\" and \"hand\" events/conditions Added /q item command which saves currently held item to the config as specified itemID Added location to Action objective, which checks the location of the block (unlike location condition which checks location of the player) Added /q event command which fires specified event Fixed multiple bugs with conversation starting and ending Block NPCs can now be used with Citizens enabled Added NPCKill objective for killing NPCs Added SetBlock event for setting a block at specified location Improved Material matching in configs Modified Action objective for greater flexibility: It is now possible to detect clicking in air It is no longer possible to detect clicking on any block (as this accepts clicking on air) Can be used to detect book reading (with help of updated Hand condition) Added AutoUpdater; it's disabled by default Notes: Conversion of configuration should have been done automatically, you don't have to worry about anything. If something went wrong you can revert changes from generated backup file, which contains all your previous configs. You can enable AutoUpdater by setting \"autoupdate\" to true in config.yml. It is completely safe because all next versions will generate backups and convert all files automatically. You will be notified on joining the server about new changelog file. Please refer to the wiki for changes in formatting instruction strings for various things: https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/wiki You probably should also change names of converted items to something else than \"item12\". But that works too of course. [1.3] - 2014-11-30 \u00b6 Changes \u00b6 UUID support (optional) NPCs made from a clay block, head and sign, for servers without Citizens2 plugin Global, long and persistent delay for events (as an objective) Folder event for multiple events, with optional short delay French translation (thanks to fastlockel) If you want to convert names to UUIDs run the plugin once and then change in the config \"uuid: false\" to true. Do not touch the \"convert: true\" option unless you want your database wiped! Conversion will happen on next plugin reload (eg. /q reload). This is not revertable! Remember to backup your config files before updating! It shouldn't destroy anything but you never know. [1.2] - 2014-11-23 \u00b6 Global locations now automatically run only once, no need for blocking it with tags and conditions. They use however tags that follow the syntax \"global_ \", where is global location objective tag. Added optional respawn location for cancelled death objective, just add \"respawn:100.5;200;300.5;world;90;0\" to instruction string. Added German translation, thanks to coalaa! Added optional movement blocking while in conversation, just add option \"stop: true\" or \"stop: false\" in every conversation. Changed priority of conversation chat event to lowest, should work even for muted players. Fixed data values in block objective. Added metrics, you can disable them by setting \"metrics: false\" in config.yml Added support for SQLite, plugin will use it when connecting to MySQL fails. Fixed death objective not working every time and not removing all effects. [1.1] - 2014-11-08 \u00b6 Fixed many bugs including but not limited to: negated conjunction condition unnecessary debug messages not working global locations Replaced config examples with default quest Leaving data values in item's definition will make plugin ignore data value in most cases Improved journal to stop text leaks Item names now replace _ with spaces [1.0] - 2014-11-06 \u00b6 Initial release","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"User-Documentation/CHANGELOG/#changelog","text":"All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

All books were automatically converted, but you need to check them if everything looks like it's supposed to. Command event accepts multiple commands separated by \"|\", eg. \"command say beton|say quest\" Event command now accepts optional argument at the end; this will fire event for player. eg. \"/q event wood_reward Steve\" Journal title and lore can now use colors (&4 etc.) and journal is colorful; options in config.yml Added aliases for /q command: bq, bquest, bquests, betonquest, betonquests, quest, quests Added aliases for /j command: bj, journal, bjournal, betonjournal Objectives are now defined directly in event instruction, not in objectives.yml (which was deleted, if you want to restore something check the backup) Replies in conversations are now optionally clickable (tellraw option in config.yml) Added permission for starting a conversation: betonquest.conversation Conversation starting/ending, updating journal, plugin's update and full inventory can now make sounds; you can find a list of possible values here: jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Sound.html Conditions for events are now defined as 'event_conditions:' instead of simply 'conditions:'. This is to distinguish conditions for objectives and for events, as both of them can exist in one instruction Updater is now run when disabling the plugin (it does matter if your server restarts every night) Notes: All Objective events has been converted to new format. The objectives.yml file has been deleted, so if it contained any objectives that weren't covered by an event they may seem lost. However there is a backup file and you can easily extract everything from it. Please refer to the wiki to learn how objectives are now defined or just study converted ones (it's pretty straightforward). AutoUpdater is now enabled by default. Every future update will be working exactly like before, all changes will be automatically updated by a converter, there is always a backup and you are informed about all changes in this file. So it's pretty safe to say that keeping this plugin up to date won't give you any trouble. If you don't want to have latest fixes and features you can disable updating but this will make the developer sad. Because of changes in how books behave since 1.8 you may experience some strange bugs with saving books to items.yml. Generally you should open a book before saving it using /q item command.

Main command details \u00b6 Reloading loads all data from configuration, but not everything is updated. Player's data isn't touched to avoid lags made by database saving. The database is also the same, you will have to reload/restart the whole server for the database to change. Tags subcommand allows you to easily list and modify tags. ' /q tags Beton ' would list tags for player Beton. ' /q tags Beton add test ' would add \"test\" tag for that player, and ' /q tags Beton del test ' would remove it. Points subcommand is similar - listing points is done the same way. Adding points to a category looks like that: ' /q points Beton add reputation 20 ' (adding 20 points to \"reputation\" category). You can also subtract points with negative amounts. Removing the whole point category can be achieved by ' /q points Beton del reputation '. Journal subcommand works in the same way as those two above. Adding and removing looks like /q journal Beton add default.wood_started (or del ), and you can also specify the date of entry when adding it, by appending date written like this: 23.04.2014_16:52 at the end of the command. Note that there is _ character instead of space! Objective subcommand allows you to list all active objectives (shown as their labels) of the player. It can also directly add or cancel objectives using instruction strings. You can also complete the objective for the player using complete argument - it will run all events and remove the objective. Running events for online players can be done with event argument: ' /q event Beton give_emeralds ' would run \"give_emeralds\" for player Beton (if he's online) from default package (not necessarily \"default\" but rather the default one specified in config.yml ). If you want to run a static event, replace player's name with - . There is also condition argument for checking conditions, for example ' /q condition Beton has_food '. Events and conditions need to be defined in their files, this command doesn't accept raw instructions. You can skip package name, the plugin will assume you're reffering to package specified in default_package option in config.yml file. If you want to check a static condition replace the player's name with - . If you need to create for example \"Nettlebane\" quest item, just hold it in your hand and type ' /q item nettlebane '. It will copy the item you're holding into the items.yml file and save it there with the name you specified (in this case \"nettlebane\"). You can skip the package name here as well. The ' /q give package.item ' command will simply give you specified item. Config subcommand is used to modify or display values in configuration files. set option replaces the value with what you typed, add simply adds your string to the existing value. (Note on spaces: by default the plugin won't insert a space between existing and added value. You can however achieve that by prefixing the string with _ character. For example: existing string is objective location , and you want to add 100;200;300;world;10 . Your command will look like /q config add default.events.loc_obj _100;200;300;world;10 ). read option allows you to display config value without modifying it. Path in this command is like an address of the value. Next branches are separated by dots. For example language setting in main configuration has path config.language , and a text in \"bye\" player option in default quest has path default.conversations.innkeeper.player_options.bye.text You can purge specific player with ' /q purge Beton ' command, where Beton is the name of the player. To purge the entire database at once simply change the prefix in config.yml or delete database.db file. Delete command (' /q delete ') allows you to delete from the database every tag, point, objective or journal entry with specified name. Rename command (' /q rename ') allows you to rename every tag, point, globalpoint, objective or journal entry in the database. In case of an objective it will also rename the objective in objectives.yml , so it continues to work correctly. If you want to backup your configuration and database make sure that your server is empty (this process requires all data to be saved to database -> all players offline) and run ' /q backup ' command. You will get a zip file containing all your data, ready to be unzipped for restoring the plugin. Update command (' /q update ') will try to download the newest version of the plugin and save it to the update folder. This folder is then handled by Spigot to update the plugin. If you accidentally use this command but do not wish to update the plugin, you should remove BetonQuest.jar file from the plugins/update folder before restarting/reloading the server. Using ' /q create beton ' command you will create new package named ' beton '. It will contain the default quest. The /q vector command allows you to create vector variables from the specified in first argument location variable to your position. The result will be saved to the \"vectors.{second argument}\" variable. The debug command (' /q debug ') allow you to enable or disable the debug mode. If the debug mode is enabled, the last 1000 log entries are written down to the latest.log file as history and write everything down until the debug mode os disabled. The file /plugins/BetonQuest/logs/latest.log is renamed to the current date and time on server start, if the debug mode is not longer active.

It will not return on its own, so you have to set a single path point with /npc path command - it will then return to that point every time. If you make it move too far away, it will teleport or break, so beware. You can change maximum pathfinding range in Citizens configuration files. The first argument in this event is ID of the NPC to move. Second one is a location in a standard format (like in teleport event). You can also specify multiple locations separated by colons to let the npc follow a path of locations. You can also specify additional arguments: block will block the NPC so you won't be able to start a conversation with him while he is moving, wait: is a number of tick the NPC will wait at its destination before firing events, done: is a list of events fired after reaching the destination, fail: is a list of events fired if this event fails. Move event can fail if the NPC is already moving for another player. Example movenpc 121 100;200;300;world,105;200;280;world block wait:20 done:msg_were_here,give_reward fail:msg_cant_go,give_reward Stop moving NPC: stopnpc \u00b6 This will stop all current move tasks for the npc with the given ID. Example stopnpc 16 Teleport NPC: teleportnpc \u00b6 This event will teleport the NPC with the given ID to the given location. Example teleportnpc 53 100;200;300;world Objectives \u00b6 NPC Interact: npcinteract \u00b6 The player has to right-click on the NPC with specified ID. It can also optionally cancel the action, so the conversation won't start. The first argument is number (ID of the NPC), and the second is optional cancel . Example npcinteract 3 cancel conditions:sneak events:steal` NPC Kill: npckill \u00b6 NPC Kill objective requires the player to kill an NPC with the given ID. You can also define how many times an NPC has to be killed. Right after objective's name there must be na ID of the NPC. You can also add an amount by amount: . Example npckill 16 amount:3 events:reward` NPC Range: npcrange \u00b6 The player has to enter/leave a circle with the given radius around the NPC to complete this objective. First argument is the ID of the NPC, second one is either enter or leave and the third one is the range. Example npcrange 3 enter 20 events:master_inRange Denizen \u00b6 Events \u00b6 Script: script \u00b6 With this event you can fire Denizen task scripts. Don't confuse it with skript event, these are different. The first and only argument is the name of the script. Example script beton EffectLib \u00b6 If you install this plugin on your server you will be able to set a particle effect on NPCs with conversations and use particle event. You can control the behaviour of particles around the NPCs in custom.yml file, in npc_effects section. Each effect is defined as a separate subsection and consists of EffectLib options (described on the EffectLib page) and several BetonQuest settings. npcs is a list of all NPCs on which this effect can be displayed. conditions is a list of conditions the player has to meet in order to see the effect. BetonQuest will find the first effect which can be displayed and show it to the player. interval controls how often the effect is displayed (in ticks). The effect will be fired from the exact location of the NPC, upwards. npc_effects : check_interval : 50 disabled : false farmer : class : VortexEffect iterations : 20 particle : crit_magic helixes : 3 circles : 1 grow : 0.1 radius : 0.5 interval : 30 npcs : - 1 conditions : - '!con_tag_started' - '!con_tag_finished' Events \u00b6 Particle: particle \u00b6 This event will load an effect defined in effects section in custom.yml file and display it on player's location. The only argument is the name of the effect. You can optionally add loc: argument followed by a location written like 100;200;300;world;180;-90 to put it on that location. If you add private argument the effect will only be displayed to the player for which you ran the event. Example In custom.yml effects : beton : class : HelixEffect iterations : 100 particle : smoke helixes : 5 circles : 20 grow : 3 radius : 30 In events.yml particle beton loc:100;200;300;world;180;-90 private` Heroes \u00b6 When you install Heroes, all kills done via this plugin's skills will be counted in MobKill objectives. Conditions \u00b6 Class: heroesclass \u00b6 This condition checks the classes of the player. The first argument must be primary , secondary or mastered . Second is the name of a class or any . You can optionally specify level: argument followed by the required level of the player. Example heroesclass mastered warrior Skill: heroesskill \u00b6 This condition checks if the player can use specified skill. The first argument is the name of the skill. Example heroesskill charge` Events \u00b6 Experience: heroesexp \u00b6 This event simply gives the player specified amount of Heroes experience. The first argument is either primary or secondary and it means player's class. Second one is the amount of experience to add. Example heroesexp primary 1000 HolographicDisplays \u00b6 Installing this plugin will enable you to create hidden holograms, which will be shown to players only if they meet specified conditions. Note that you need to have ProtocolLib installed in order to hide holograms from certain players. In order to create a hologram, you have to add holograms section in your custom.yml file. Add a node named as your hologram to this section and define lines , conditions and location subnodes. The fist one should be a list of texts - these will be the lines of a hologram. Color codes are supported. Second is a list of conditions separated by commas. Third is a location in a standard format, like in teleport event. An example of such hologram definition: holograms : beton : lines : - '&bThis is Beton.' - 'item:custom_item' - '&eBeton is strong.' location : 100;200;300;world conditions : has_some_quest, !finished_some_quest # How often to check conditions (optional) check_interval : 20 A line can also represent a floating item. To do so enter the line as 'item: custom_item '. It will be replaced with the custom_item defined defined in items.yml. If the Item is defined for example as map, a floating map will be seen between two lines of text. The holograms are updated every 10 seconds. If you want to make it faster, add hologram_update_interval option in config.yml file and set it to a number of ticks you want to pass between updates (one second is 20 ticks). Don't set it to 0 or negative numbers, it will result in an error. If Citizens is also installed then you can have holograms configured relative to an npc. Add the following to custom.yml . npc_holograms : # How often to check conditions check_interval : 100 # Holograms follow npcs when they move (higher cpu usage when true) follow : false # Disable npc_holograms disabled : false # Hologram Settings default : # Lines in hologram lines : - \"Some text!\" # Vector offset to NPC position to place hologram vector : 0;3;0 # Conditions to display hologram conditions : has_some_quest, !finished_some_quest # NPC's to apply these settings to. If blank, applies by default npcs : - 0 - 22 Item lines are also supported here. JobsReborn \u00b6 Requires adding the following to config.yml : hook : jobs : 'true' Conditions \u00b6 Can Level up: nujobs_canlevel {jobname} \u00b6 Returns true if the player can level up Has Job: nujobs_hasjob {jobname} \u00b6 Returns true if the player has this job Example nujobs_hasjob Woodcutter Job Full: nujobs_jobfull {jobname} \u00b6 Returns true if the job is at the maximum slots Job Level: nujobs_joblevel {jobname} {min} {max} \u00b6 Returns true if the player has this job, and at a level equal to or between the min/max Example nujobs_joblevel Woodcutter 5 10 Events \u00b6 Add Experience: nujobs_addexp {jobname} {exp} \u00b6 Gives the player experience Increase Level: nujobs_addlevel {jobname} {amount} \u00b6 Increases the player level by amount. Decrease Level: nujobs_dellevel {jobname} {amount} \u00b6 Decreases the players level by amount. Join Job: nujobs_joinjob {jobname} \u00b6 Joins the player to job. Leave Job: nujobs_leavejob {jobname} \u00b6 Removes the player from job. Set Level: nujobs_setlevel {jobname} {level} \u00b6 Set the player to level. Objectives \u00b6 Join Job: nujobs_joinjob {jobname} \u00b6 Triggers when player joins job. Leave Job: nujobs_leavejob {jobname} \u00b6 Triggers when player leaves job. Notice This is not triggered by '/jobs leaveall' Job Levelup: nujobs_levelup {jobname} \u00b6 Triggers when player levels up. Job Payment: nujobs_payment {amount} \u00b6 Triggers when player makes {amount} of money from jobs. Magic \u00b6 Conditions \u00b6 Wand: wand \u00b6 This condition can check wands. The first argument is either hand , inventory or lost . If you choose lost , the condition will check if the player has lost a wand. If you choose hand , the condition will check if you're holding a wand in your hand. inventory will check your whole inventory instead of just the hand. In case of hand and inventory arguments you can also add optional name: argument followed by the name of the wand (as defined in wands.yml in Magic plugin) to check if it's the specific type of the wand. In the case of inventory you can specify an amount with amount and this will only return true if a player has that amount. You can also use optional spells: argument, followed by a list of spells separated with a comma. Each spell in this list can have defined minimal level required, after a colon. Example wand hand name:master spells:flare,missile:2 McMMO \u00b6 Conditions \u00b6 Level: mcmmolevel \u00b6 This conditions checks if the player has high enough level in the specified skill. The first argument is the name of the skill, second one is the minimum level the player needs to have to pass this condition. Example mcmmolevel woodcutting 50 Events \u00b6 Experience: mcmmoexp \u00b6 This event adds experience points in a specified skill. The first argument is the name of the skill, second one is the amount of experience to add. Example mcmmoexp swords 1500 MythicMobs \u00b6 Having MythicMobs allows you to use MythicMobs MobKill objective and MythicMobs SpawnMob event. Objectives \u00b6 MobKill: mmobkill \u00b6 To complete this objective you need to kill specified amount of MythicMobs. The first argument must be the mob's internal name (the one defined in MythicMobs' configuration). You can optionally add amount: argument to specify how many of these mobs the player needs to kill. You can also add \"notify\" keyword if you want to display to players the amount of mobs left to kill. Example mmobkill SkeletalKnight amount:2 events:reward SpawnMob: mspawnmob \u00b6 Spawn specified amount of MythicMobs at given location. The first argument is a location defined like 100;200;300;world . Second is MythicMobs internal name (the one defined in MythicMobs' configuration) followed by a colon and a level. Third one is amount and it's required! Example mspawnmob 100;200;300;world SkeletalKnight:1 5 PlaceholderAPI \u00b6 If you have this plugin, BetonQuest will add a betonquest placeholder to it and you will be able to use ph variable in your conversations. Placeholder: betonquest \u00b6 In any other plugin which uses PlaceholderAPI you can use BetonQuest variables with %betonquest_package:variable% placeholder. The package: part is the name of a package. If you skip this, the plugin will assume you're using that variable in default package. The variable part is just a BetonQuest variable without percentage characters, like point.beton.amount . Example % betonquest_someGreatQuest:objective.killZombies.left% Variable: ph \u00b6 You can also use placeholders from other plugins in BetonQuest. Simply insert a variable starting with ph , the second argument should be the placeholder without percentage characters. Example % ph.player_item_in_hand% PlayerPoints \u00b6 Conditions \u00b6 PlayerPoints: playerpoints \u00b6 This condition simply checks if the player has specified amount of points in the PlayerPoints plugin. The only argument is a number. Example playerpoints 100 Events \u00b6 PlayerPoints: playerpoints \u00b6 This event simply adds, removes or multiplies points in the PlayerPoints plugin. The only argument is a number, it can be positive, negative or prefixed with an asterisk for multiplication. Example playerpoints *2 ProtocolLib \u00b6 Hiding NPC's \u00b6 Having ProtocolLib installed will let you hide Citizens NPCs if specified conditions are met. You can do that by adding hide_npcs section to custom.yml file in your package. There you can assign conditions to specific NPC IDs: hide_npcs : 41 : killedAlready,questStarted 127 : '!questStarted' Conversation IO: menu \u00b6 A conversation IO that makes use of a chat menu system. A video of it in action can be seen here . Customize how it looks by adding the following lines to custom.yml: menu_conv_io : line_length : 50 refresh_delay : 180 npc_wrap : '&l &r' npc_text : '&l &r&f{npc_text}' npc_text_reset : '&f' option_wrap : '&r&l &l &l &l &r' option_text : '&l &l &l &l &r&8[ &b{option_text}&8 ]' option_text_reset : '&b' option_selected : '&l &r &r&7\u00bb&r &8[ &f&n{option_text}&8 ]' option_selected_reset : '&f' option_selected_wrap : '&r&l &l &l &l &r&f&n' control_select : jump,left_click control_cancel : sneak control_move : scroll,move npc_name_type : chat npc_name_align : center npc_name_format : '&e{npc_name}&r' Where: line_length - Maximum size of a line till its wrapped refresh_delay - Specify how many ticks to auto update display. Default 180 npc_wrap - What text to prefix each new line in the NPC text that wraps npc_text - How to write the NPC text. Replaces {1} with the npcs text npc_text_reset - When a color reset is found, what to replace it with option_wrap - What text to prefix each new line in an option that wraps option_text - How to write an option. Replaces {1} with the option text option_text_reset - When a color reset is found, what to replace it with option_selected - How to write a selected option. Replaces {1} with the option text option_selected_reset - When a color reset is found, what to replace it with option_selected_wrap - What text to prefix each new line in a selected option that wraps control_select - Space separated actions to select. Can be any of 'jump', 'left_click', 'sneak' control_cancel - Space separated actions to select. Can be any of 'jump', 'left_click', 'sneak' control_move - Space separated actions to move selection. Can be any of 'move', 'scroll' npc_name_type - Type of NPC name display. Can be one of: 'none', 'chat' npc_name_align - For npc name type of 'chat', how to align name. One of: 'left', 'right', 'center' npc_name_format - How to format the npc name Variables: {npc_text} - The text the NPC says {option_text} - The option text {npc_name} - The name of the NPC Chat Interceptor: packet \u00b6 Intercept pretty much anything sent to the player by intercepting packets sent to them. This can be enabled by default by setting the default_interceptor to packet in config.yml or per conversation by setting interceptor to packet in the top level of the conversation. Quests \u00b6 Quests is another questing plugin, which offers very simple creation of quests. If you don't want to spend a lot of time to write advanced quests in BetonQuest but you need a specific thing from this plugin you can use Custom Event Reward or Custom Condition Requirement. Alternatively, if you have a lot of quests written in Quests, but want to integrate them with the conversation system, you can use quest event and quest condition. Condition Requirement (Quests) \u00b6 When adding requirements to a quest, choose \"Custom requirement\" and then select \"BetonQuest condition\". Now specify condition's name and it's package (like package.conditionName ). Quests will check BetonQuest condition when starting the quest. Event Reward (Quests) \u00b6 When adding rewards to a quest or a stage, choose \"Custom reward\" and then select \"BetonQuest event\". Now specify event's name and it's package (like package.eventName ). Quests will fire BetonQuest event when this reward will run. Conditions \u00b6 Quest condition: quest \u00b6 This condition is met when the player has completed the specified quest. The first and only argument is the name of the quest. It it contains any spaces replace them with _ . Example quest stone_miner Events \u00b6 Quest: quest \u00b6 This event will start the quest for the player. The first argument must be the name of the quest, as defined in name option in the quest. If the name contains any spaces replace them with _ . You can optionally add check-requirements argument if you want the event to respect this quest's requirements (otherwise the quest will be forced to be started). Example quest stone_miner check-requirements RPGMenu \u00b6 New events \u00b6 Menu event: menu \u00b6 This event can be used to open and close menus. The first argument is the type of action that should be done. It is either open to open a new menu or close to close the currently opened menu of the player. If you want to open a menu you have to add a second argument which should be the id of a menu. If you want to open menus from other packages just use packageName.id format. Example menu open quest_gui menu close New conditions \u00b6 Menu condition: menu \u00b6 This condition can be used to check if the player has crurently opened any menu. You can add id: optional and specify the id of a menu to check if the player has opened the menu with this id. If you want to check for menus from other packages just use packageName.id format. Example menu id:quest_gui New objectives \u00b6 menu objective: menu \u00b6 This objective is completed when the player opens the menu with the given id. The only required argument is the id of the menu. If you want to use menus from other packages just use packageName.id format. The objective also has the property menu which can be used by the objective variable . It returns the title of the menu which should be opened. Example menu quest_gui New Variables \u00b6 menu variable: menu \u00b6 This variable displays the title of the menu that is currently opened by the player. If no menu is opened it will be just empty. Example % menu% Shopkeepers \u00b6 Conditions \u00b6 Shop amount: shopamount \u00b6 This condition checks if the player owns specified (or greater) amount of shops. It doesn't matter what type these shops are. The only argument is a number - minimum amount of shops. Example shopamount 2 Events \u00b6 Open shop window: shopkeeper \u00b6 This event opens a trading window of a Villager. The only argument is the uniqueID of the shop. You can find it in Shopkeepers/saves.yml file, under uniqueID option. Example shopkeeper b687538e-14ce-4b77-ae9f-e83b12f0b929 SkillAPI \u00b6 Conditions \u00b6 Class: skillapiclass \u00b6 This condition checks if the player has specified class or a child class of the specified one. The first argument is simply the name of a class. You can add exact argument if you want to check for that exact class, without checking child classes. Example skillapiclass warrior Level: skillapilevel \u00b6 This condition checks if the player has specified or greater level is the specified class. The first argument is class name, the second one is the required level. Example skillapilevel warrior 3 Skript \u00b6 BetonQuest can also hook into Skript. Firstly, to avoid any confusion, I will refere to everything here by name of the plugin (Skript event is something else than BetonQuest event). Having Skript on your server will enable using BetonQuest events and conditions in scripts, and also trigger them by BetonQuest event. Skript event triggered by BetonQuest skript event \u00b6 This entry will describe two things: Skript event and BetonQuest event. Skript event - on [betonquest] event \"id\" - this is the line you use in your scripts to trigger the code. betonquest part is optional, and id is just some string, which must be equal to the one you specified in BetonQuest event. BetonQuest event - skript - this event will trigger the above Skript event in your scripts. The instruction string accepts only one argument, id of the event. It have to be the same as the one defined in Skript event for it to be triggered. Example In your script on betonquest event \"concrete\" : In events.yml fire_concrete_script : skript concrete Skript condition \u00b6 You can check BetonQuest conditions in your scripts by using the syntax player meets [betonquest] condition \"id\" . betonquest is optional, and id is the name of the condition, as defined in conditions.yml . Example In your script player meets condition \"has_ore\" In conditions.yml has_ore : item iron_ore:5 Skript event \u00b6 You can also fire BetonQuest events with scripts. The syntax for Skript effect is fire [betonquest] event \"id\" for player . Everything else works just like in condition above. Example In your script fire event \"give_emeralds\" for player In events.yml give_emeralds : give emerald:5 Vault \u00b6 By installing Vault you enable Permission event and Money condition/event. Conditions \u00b6 Money: money \u00b6 Checks if the player has specified amount of money. You can specify only one argument, amount integer. It cannot be negative! Example money 500 Events \u00b6 Money: money \u00b6 Deposits, withdraws or multiplies money on player's account. There is only one argument, amount of money to modify. It can be positive, negative or start with an asterisk for multiplication. Example money -100 Permission: permission \u00b6 Adds or removes a permission or a group. First argument is add or remove . It's self-explanatory. Second is perm or group . It also shouldn't be hard to figure out. Next thing is actual string you want to add/remove. At the end you can also specify world in which you want these permissions. If the world name is ommited then permission/group will be global. Example permission remove group bandit world_nether Variables \u00b6 Money: money \u00b6 There is only one argument in this variable, amount for showing money amount or left: followed by a number for showing the difference between it and amount of money. Example % money.left:500% WorldEdit \u00b6 Events \u00b6 Paste schematic: paste \u00b6 This event will paste a schematic at the given location. The first argument is a location and the second one is the name of schematic file. The file must be located in WorldEdit/schematics and have a name like some_building.schematic . An optional noair can be added to paste ignoring air blocks. If you have only a .schem schematic, simply append .schem to the schematic name. Example paste 100;200;300;world some_building noair WorldGuard \u00b6 Conditions \u00b6 Inside Region: region \u00b6 This condition is met when the player is inside the specified region. The only argument is the name of the region. Example region beton Objectives \u00b6 Enter Region: region \u00b6 To complete this objective you need to enter WorldGuard region with specified name. A required argument is the name of the region and you may also pass an optional entry and/or exit to only trigger when entering or exiting a region instead of anytime inside a region. Example region beton events:kill","title":"Compatibility List"},{"location":"User-Documentation/Compatibility/#compatibility","text":"BetonQuest can hook into other plugins to extend its functionality.

Note that you need to have ProtocolLib installed in order to hide holograms from certain players. In order to create a hologram, you have to add holograms section in your custom.yml file. Add a node named as your hologram to this section and define lines , conditions and location subnodes. The fist one should be a list of texts - these will be the lines of a hologram. Color codes are supported. Second is a list of conditions separated by commas. Third is a location in a standard format, like in teleport event. An example of such hologram definition: holograms : beton : lines : - '&bThis is Beton.' - 'item:custom_item' - '&eBeton is strong.' location : 100;200;300;world conditions : has_some_quest, !finished_some_quest # How often to check conditions (optional) check_interval : 20 A line can also represent a floating item. To do so enter the line as 'item: custom_item '. It will be replaced with the custom_item defined defined in items.yml. If the Item is defined for example as map, a floating map will be seen between two lines of text. The holograms are updated every 10 seconds. If you want to make it faster, add hologram_update_interval option in config.yml file and set it to a number of ticks you want to pass between updates (one second is 20 ticks). Don't set it to 0 or negative numbers, it will result in an error. If Citizens is also installed then you can have holograms configured relative to an npc. Add the following to custom.yml . npc_holograms : # How often to check conditions check_interval : 100 # Holograms follow npcs when they move (higher cpu usage when true) follow : false # Disable npc_holograms disabled : false # Hologram Settings default : # Lines in hologram lines : - \"Some text!\" # Vector offset to NPC position to place hologram vector : 0;3;0 # Conditions to display hologram conditions : has_some_quest, !finished_some_quest # NPC's to apply these settings to.

Example globaltag global_areNPCsAgressive Item in Hand: hand \u00b6 This event is met only when player is holding a specified item in his hand. Amount cannot be set here, though it may be checked with item condition. Example hand sword Health: health \u00b6 Requires the player to have equal or more health than specified amount. The only argument is a number (double). Players can have 0 to 20 health by default (there are some plugins and commands which change the maximum) (0 means dead, don't use that since it will only be met when the player sees the red respawn screen). Example health 5.6 Height: height \u00b6 This condition requires the player to be below specific Y height. The required argument is a number or a location (for example 100;200;300;world).

Example height 16 Item in Inventory: item \u00b6 This event is met only when player has specified item in his inventory. You specify items in a list separated by commas (without spaces between!) Each item consists of its name and amount, separated by a colon. Amount is optional, so if you specify just item's name the plugin will assume there should be only one item. Example item emerald:5,gold:10` Journal entry: journal \u00b6 This condition will return true if the player has specified entry in his journal (internal name of the entry, like in journal.yml ). The only argument is name of the entry. Example journal wood_started Location: location \u00b6 It returns true only when the player is closer to specified location than the specified distance. Just two mandatory attributes - location and radius around it (can be a variable). Example location 100;200;300;survival_nether 5 Looking at a block: looking \u00b6 Checks if the player is looking at a block with the given location or material. You must specify either loc: optional (the location of the block) or type: optional as a block selector . You can also specify both. Example looking loc:12.0;14.0;-15.0;world type:STONE Moon Cycle: mooncycle \u00b6 This condition checks the players moon cycle (1 is full moon, 8 is Waxing Gibbous) and returns if the player is under that moon. A list of phases can be found here . Example mooncycle 1 Objective: objective \u00b6 This conditions is very simple: it's true only when the player has an active objective. The only argument is the name of the objective, as defined in objectives.yml . Example objective wood Alternative: or \u00b6 Alternative of specified conditions. This means that only one of conditions has to be met in order for alternative to be true. You just define one mandatory argument, condition names separated by commas. ! prefix works as always. Example or night,rain,!has_armor Partial date: partialdate \u00b6 The current date must match the given pattern. You can specify the day of the month, the month or the year it must be that this condition returns true or combine them. You can also specify multiple days/months/years by just separating them by , or a interval by using - . If you have trouble understanding how this works have a look at the example. The example is true between the 1 st and the 5 th or on the 20 th of each month, but only in the year 2017. Example partialdate day:1-5,20 year:2017 Party: party \u00b6 To see details about parties read \"Party\" chapter in Reference section. This condition takes three optional arguments: every: , any: and count: . \"Every\" is a list of conditions that must be met by every player in the party. Any is a list of conditions that must be met by at least one player in a party (it doesn't have to be the same player, one can meet first condition, another one can meet the rest and it will work). Count is just a number, minimal amount of players in the party. You don't have to specify all those arguments, you can use only one if you want. Example party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 every:some_item any:some_location,some_other_item count:5 Permission: permission \u00b6 The player must have a specified permission for this condition to be met. The instruction string must contain permission node as the required argument. Example permission essentials.tpa Point: point \u00b6 Requires the player to have amount of points equal to the specified category or more. There are two required arguments, first is the category (string), second is the amount (integer). You can also add optional argument equal to accept only players with exactly equal amount of points. Example point beton 20 Random: random \u00b6 persistent , static This condition is met randomly. There is one argument: two positive numbers like 5-12 . They mean something like that: \"It will be true 5 times out of 12\". Example random 12-100 Armor Rating: rating \u00b6 This one requires the player to wear armor which gives him specified amount of protection (armor icons). The first and only argument should be an integer. One armor point is equal to half armor icon in-game (10 means half of the bar filled). Example rating 10 Real time: realtime \u00b6 There must a specific (real) time for this condition to return true. You need to specify two times (formatted like hh:mm ) separated by dash. If the first is before the second the time must be between these two, if its after the second the time must be later than the first and earlier than the second to return true. Example realtime 8:00-12:30 Scoreboard: score \u00b6 With this condition you can check if the score in a specified objective on a scoreboard is greater or equal to specified amount. The first argument is the name of the objective, second one is amount (an integer). Example score kills 20 Sneaking: sneak \u00b6 Sneak condition is only true when the player is sneaking. This would probably be useful for creating traps, I'm not sure. There are no arguments for this one. Example sneak Tag: tag \u00b6 This one requires the player to have a specified tag. Together with ! negation it is one of the most powerful tools when creating conversations. The instruction string must contain tag name. Example tag quest_completed Test for block: testforblock \u00b6 persistent , static This condition is met if the block at specified location matches the given material. First argument is a location, and the second one is a block selector . The older data:value parameter is still supported but now deprecated. Example testforblock 100;200;300;world STONE:1 Time: time \u00b6 There must be specific (Minecraft) time on the player's world for this condition to return true. You need to specify two hour numbers separated by dash. These number are normal 24-hour format hours. The first must be smaller than the second. If you want to achieve time period between 23 and 2 you need to negate the condition. Example time 2-23 Variable: variable \u00b6 This condition checks if a variable value matches given pattern . The first argument is a variable (with % characters). Second one is the pattern (for example, if you want to check if it's \"word\", the patter would simply be word , but if you want to check if it's a number (positive or negative) you would use -?\\d+ pattern - -? means a dash or no dash, \\d means any digit and + allows that digit to be repeated one or more times). Example variable %objective.var.price% -?\\d+ Weather: weather \u00b6 There must be a specific weather for this condition to return true. There are three possible options: sun, rain and storm. Note that /toggledownfall does not change the weather, it just does what the name suggests: toggles downfall. The rain toggled off will still be considered as rain! Use /weather clear instead. Example weather sun World: world \u00b6 This conditions checks if the player is in a specified world. The first argument is the name of a world.

Therefore, it will look like as if the player did send the message. The instruction string is the command, without leading slash. You can only use %player% as a variable in this event. Additional messages can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \\| . If a plugin does not work with the sudo / command event you need to use this event.

Example chestclear 100;200;300;world Chest Give: chestgive \u00b6 persistent , static This works the same as give event, but it puts the items in a chest at specified location. The first argument is a location, the second argument is a list of items, like in give event. If the chest is full, the items will be dropped on the ground. The chest can be any other block with inventory, i.e. a hopper or a dispenser. BetonQuest will log an error to the console when this event is fired but there is no chest at specified location. Example chestgive 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword Chest Take: chesttake \u00b6 persistent , static This event works the same as take event, but it takes items from a chest at specified location. The instruction string is defined in the same way as in chestgive event. Example chesttake 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword Clear mobs: clear \u00b6 This event removes all specified mobs from the specified area. The first required argument is a list of mobs (taken from here ) separated by commas. Next is location. After that there is the radius around the location (a positive number or a variable). You can also optionally specify name: argument, followed by name which removed mobs must have. You can use marked: argument to remove only mobs marked in spawn event. Example clear ZOMBIE,CREEPER 100;200;300;world 10 name:Monster Compass: compass \u00b6 When you run this event, you can add or remove a compass destination for the player. You may also directly set the players's compass destination as well. When a destination is added the player will be able to select a specified location as a target of his compass. To select the target the player must open his backpack and click on the compass icon. The first argument is add , del or set , and second one is the name of the target, as defined in main.yml . Note that if you set a target the player will not automatically have it added to their choices. The destination must be defined in the main.yml file in compass section. You can specify a name for the target in each language or just give a general name, and optionally add a custom item (from items.yml ) to be displayed in the backpack. Example of a compass target: compass : beton : name : en : Target pl : Cel location : 100;200;300;world item : scroll Example compass add beton Command: command \u00b6 persistent , static Runs specified command from the console. The instruction string is the command, without leading slash. You can use variables here, but variables other than %player% won't resolve if the event is fired from delayed folder and the player is offline now. You can define additional commands by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the command use \\| . Example command kill %player%|ban %player% Conversation: conversation \u00b6 Starts a conversation at location of the player. The only argument is ID of the conversation. This bypasses the conversation permission! Example conversation village_smith Damage player: damage \u00b6 Damages the player by specified amount of damage. The only argument is a number (can have floating point). Example damage 20 Door: door \u00b6 persistent , static This event can open and close doors, trapdoors and fence gates. The syntax is exactly the same as in lever event above. Example door 100;200;300;world off Remove Potion Effect: deleffect \u00b6 Removes the specified potion effects from the player. Use any instead of a list of types to remove all potion effects from the player. Example deleffect ABSORPTION,BLINDNESS Potion Effect: effect \u00b6 Adds a specified potion effect to player. First argument is potion type. You can find all available types here . Second is integer defining how long the effect will last in seconds. Third argument, also integer, defines level of the effect (1 means first level). Add a parameter ambient to make potion particles appear more invisible (just like beacon effects). To hide particles add a parameter hidden . To hide the icon for the effect add noicon . Example effect BLINDNESS ambient icon Explosion: explosion \u00b6 static Creates an explosion. It can make fire and destroy blocks. You can also define power, so be careful not to blow your server away. Default TNT power is 4, while Wither on creation is 7. First argument can be 0 or 1 and states if explosion will generate fire (like Ghast\u2019s fireball). Second is also 0 or 1 but this defines if block will be destroyed or not. Third argument is the power (float number). At the end (4 th attribute) there is location. Example explosion 0 1 4 100;64;-100;survival Folder: folder \u00b6 persistent , static It's something like a container for multiple events. You can use it to clarify your code. It also features optional delay measured in seconds (you can use ticks or minutes if you add ticks or minutes argument). It is persistent for events marked as persistent , which means that the events will be fired even after the player logs out. Beware though, all conditions are false then the player is offline (even inverted ones), so those events should not be blocked by any conditions! The only required argument is a list of events separated by commas. There are also two optional arguments: delay: and random: . Delay is a number of seconds and it's optional (leaving it blank is the same as delay:0 . Random is the amount of events, that will be randomly chosen to fire. If set to 0 or omited, it does nothing (all events will fire). Example folder event1,event2,event3 delay:5 random:1 Give Items: give \u00b6 Gives the player predefined items. They are specified exactly as in item condition - list separated by commas, every item can have amount separated by colon. Default amount is 1. If the player doesn't have required space in the inventory, the items are dropped on the ground, unless they are quest items. Then they will be put into the backpack. You can also specify notify keyword to display a simple message to the player about receiving items. Example give emerald:5,emerald_block:9 Give journal: givejournal \u00b6 This event simply gives the player his journal. It acts the same way as /j command would. Example givejournal Global point: globalpoint \u00b6 persistent , static This works the same way as the normal point event but instead to manipulating the points for a category of a specific player it manipulates points in a global category. These global categories are player independent, so you could for example add a point to such a global category every time a player does a quest and give some special rewards for the 100 th player who does the quest. Example globalpoint global_knownusers 1 Global tag: globaltag \u00b6 persistent , static Works the same way as a normal tag event, but instead of setting a tag for one player it sets it globaly for all players. Example globaltag add global_areNPCsAgressive If else: if \u00b6 This event will check a condition, and based on the outcome it will run the first or second event. The instruction string is if condition event1 else event2 , where condition is a condition ID and event1 and event2 are event IDs. else keyword is mandatory between events for no practical reason. Example if sun rain else sun Journal: journal \u00b6 Adds or deletes an entry to/from player\u2019s journal. Entries are defined in journal.yml The first argument is action (add/del), the second one is name of the entry. You can also use only one argument, update , it will simply update the journal without addin any entries. It's useful when you need to update the main page. Example journal add quest_started Example journal update` Kill: kill \u00b6 Kills the player. Nothing else. Kill Mobs: killmob \u00b6 persistent , static Kills all mobs of given type at the location. First argument is the type of the mob . Next argument is the location. Third argument is the radius around the location, in which the mobs must be to get killed. You can also specify name: argument, followed by the name of the mob which should get killed. All _ characters will be replaced with spaces. If you want to kill only mobs that have been marked using the spawn mob event use marked: argument followed by the keyword. Only mobs that are in loaded chunks can be killed by using this event. Example killmob ZOMBIE 100;200;300;world 40 name:Bolec Language: language \u00b6 This event changes player's language to the specified one. There is only one argument, the language name. Example language es Lever: lever \u00b6 persistent , static This event can switch a lever. The first argument is a location and the second one is state: on , off or toggle . Example lever 100;200;300;world toggle Lightning: lightning \u00b6 static Strikes a lightning at given location. The only argument is the location. Example lightning 100;64;-100;survival Message: message \u00b6 static This event simply displays a message to the player. The instruction string is the message. All & color codes are respected. You can add additional translations by starting them with {lang} argument, just like in the example. The player will see his language or the default one if it's not defined. You can use conversation variables with this event. Just make sure not to use %npc% . Example message {en} &4You are banned, %player%! {pl} &4Jestes zbanowany, %player%! {de}&4Ich wei\u00df nicht. Notification: notify \u00b6 Trigger a notification using the NotifyIO system. The first arguments are the message to send. A comma seperated list can be provided to an optional category tag to use a Notification Category. You can optionally set which NotifyIO to use by providing it with an io tag. You can also optionally pass flags in the form of key : value to provide custom config to the NotifyIO that will override those by the category used. Please note that if you don't provide a valid category and haven't defined a default category then you must provide an io flag otherwise the default io (Generally chat) will be used. Please refer to the Notification chapter for more details. Example notify This is a test category:MyCategory io:bossbar barColor:red sound:BLOCK_CHEST_CLOSE` Objective: objective \u00b6 persistent , static Manages the objectives. Syntax is objective <action> name , where <action> can be start / add (one of the two), delete / remove or complete / finish . Name is the name of the objective, as defined in objectives.yml . Example objective start wood OPSudo: opsudo \u00b6 This event is similar to command event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player with temporary OP permissions. Additional commands can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \\| . Example sudo spawn Party event: party \u00b6 Runs the specified list of events (third argument) for every player in a party. More info about parties in \"Party\" chapter in Reference section. Example party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 give_reward Pick random: pickrandom \u00b6 persistent , static Another container for events. It picks one (ore multiple) of the given events and runs it (but only if all conditions are true, if not it will do nothing). You must specify how likely it is that each event is picked by adding the percentage before the events id. By default it picks one event from the list but you can add a amount: optional if you want more to be picked. Note that only as many events as specified can be picked and amount:0 will do nothing. Example pickrandom 20.5%event1,0.5%event2,79%event3 amount:2 Play sound: playsound \u00b6 This event will play a specified sound for the player. The only required argument is the sound name in lower case letters (can take custom values if you're using a resource pack). There are also a few optional arguments. category: is the sound category (if not specified it will use MASTER ), volume: is a decimal responsible for the sound's volume, pitch: specifies the pitch and location: makes the sound play at specified location. Example playsound : playsound minecraft:entity.ender_dragon.hurt category:MASTER volume:0.8 pitch:0.8 location:-60;69;-336;World` Point: point \u00b6 persistent Gives the player a specified amount of points in a specified category. Amount can be negative if you want to subtract points. You can also use an asterisk to do multiplication (or division, if you use a fraction). First argument after the event name must be a category, and the second one - amount of points to give/take/multiply. Example point npc_attitude 10 Example point village_reputation *0.75 Run events: run \u00b6 This event allow for specifying multiple instruction strings in one, longer string. Each instruction must be started with ^ character and no other dividers should be used. It's not the same as folder condition, because you can specify an instruction string, not an event name. It is also fired on the same tick, not on the next one like in folder . Don't use conditions here, it behaves strangely. I'll fix this in 1.9 version. Example run ^tag add beton ^give emerald:5 ^entry add beton ^kill Scoreboard: score \u00b6 This event works in the same way as point event, the only difference is that is uses scoreboards instead of points. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide scores in objectives on the scoreboard. The first argument is the name of the objective, second one is a number. It can be positive for additon, negative for subtraction or prefixed with an asterisk for multiplication. Multiplying by fractions is the same as dividing. Example score kills 1 Set Block: setblock \u00b6 persistent , static Sets a block at given location to specified material. Useful for triggering redstone contraptions. There are two required arguments. First is required, and should be material's name ( List of materials ). Second is a location and is also required. Last, optional is data: with an integer, which defines block's data value. Default is 0. Example setblock REDSTONE_BLOCK 100;200;300;world Spawn Mob: spawn \u00b6 persistent , static Spawns specified amount of mobs of given type at the location. First argument is a location. Next is type of the mob . The last, third argument is integer for amount of mobs to be spawned. You can also specify name: argument, followed by the name of the mob. All _ characters will be replaced with spaces. You can also mark the spawned mob with a keyword using marked: argument. It won't show anywhere, and you can check for only marked mobs in mobkill objective. You can specify armor which the mob will wear and items it will hold with h: (helmet), c: (chestplate), l: (leggings), b: (boots), m: (main hand) and o: (off hand) optional arguments. These take a single item without amount, as defined in items.yml . You can also add a list of drops with drops: argument, followed by a list of items with amounts after colons, separated by commas. Example spawn 100;200;300;world SKELETON 5 marked:targets Example spawn 100;200;300;world ZOMBIE name:Bolec 1 h:blue_hat c:red_vest drops:emerald:10,bread:2 Sudo: sudo \u00b6 This event is similar to command event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player. Additional commands can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \\| . Example sudo spawn Tag: tag \u00b6 persistent This event adds (or removes) a tag to the player. The first argument after event's name must be add or del . Next goes the tag name. It can't contain spaces (though _ is fine). Additional tags can be added, separated by commas (without spaces). Example tag add quest_started,new_entry Take Items: take \u00b6 Removes items from player\u2019s inventory or backpack (in that order). If the items aren't quest items don't use take event with player options in conversations! The player can drop items before selecting the option and pickup them after the event fires. Validate it on NPC\u2019s reaction! Defining instruction string is the same as in give event. You can also specify notify keyword to display a simple message to the player about loosing items. Example take emerald:120,sword Time: time \u00b6 Sets or adds time. The only argument is time to be set (integer) or time to be added (integer prefixed with +), in 24 hours format. Subtracting time is done by adding more time (if you think of this, it actually makes sense). Minutes can be achieved with floating point. Example time +6 Title: title \u00b6 This event displays a title or a subtitle. The first argument is the type ( title or subtitle ), second argument are title's duration times (in ticks) separated by semicolons - fade in, stay and fade out: 20;100;20 . If you set it to three zeros ( 0;0;0 ) the plugin will use default Minecraft values. After these two required arguments there is a title message, formatted like in the message event, which supports multiple languages, color codes and variables. Keep in mind that the subtitle will only appear if the title is visible - that's how Minecraft works. Example title subtitle 0;0;0 {en} Lobby joined! {pl} Do\u0142\u0105czono do lobby! Teleport: teleport \u00b6 Teleports the player to a specified location, with or without head rotation. It will also end the conversation, if the player has one active.The first and only argument must be location. It's a good idea to use yaw and pitch here. Example teleport 123;32;-789;world_the_nether;180;45 Variable: variable \u00b6 This event has only one purpose - to change variables stored in variable objective. The first argument is the ID of a variable objective (if you use any other type you will get an error). Second one is the key of the variable and the third is the value. Both can use %...% variables. Refer to variable objective documentation for information about storing variables. Example variable some_var_obj name %player% Weather: weather \u00b6 Sets weather. The argument is sun , rain or storm . Example weather rain Give experience: xp \u00b6 Gives the specified amount of experience points to the player. If you want to give whole levels to a player add the level argument.

What is a NotifyIO \u00b6 A NotifyIO is some method of sending a notification out. BetonQuest provides some by default and third party plugins may register their own. The following are provided by default: suppress - Does not send anything. Good at turning off some notifications. chat - (Default) Sends the notification as a chat message advancement - Sends a notification via a popup advancement actionbar - Sends a notification via the actionbar bossbar - Sends a notification via a bossbar title - Sends a notification via a title subtitle - Sends a notification via a subtitle Default NotifyIO \u00b6 If not set, the default NotifyIO is chat . You can change the default to actionbar by setting the following in `config.yml': default_notify_IO : actionbar Configuring Notifications \u00b6 When a notification is generated it will usually have one or more categories assigned to it. These categories are searched for, in order, in all custom.yml files under the section notifications . The first category found will be used to configured the notification. If none were found then a category of default will be search for. A typical custom.yml file may have the following: notifications : # A new journal entry has been added new_journal_entry : io : advancement frame : challenge icon : map # All infomation notifications info : io : chat sound : BLOCK_CHEST_CLOSE When a new journal entry is added, it will send a notification with the following categories: new_journal_entry info In the above file, it will find new_journal_entry first so will ignore info . This defines the settings for the notification by using the advancement notifyIO with a challenge frame and a map for the icon. When a new changelog occurs it will send a notification using the following categories: changelog info In the above file, it will find info which defines that it should be sent via the chat with a specific sound played as well. Categories \u00b6 Categories are a way of defining settings for a notification. BetonQuest uses many categories itself but you can define your own custom categories and use them through the notify event. In general a BetonQuest notification will use the same category name for a notification as it uses in messages.yml to define the language and text of the notification. It will also use more general categories to allow you to more broadly define settings and only provide specific settings for some notifications. Remember the categories are searched for in order so the first category will be used in preference to those later in the list. A list of categories used by BetonQuest are as follows: Notification Categories Pullback pullback, error Command Blocked command_blocked,error No Permission no_permission,error Busy busy,error Changelog changelog,info Inventory Full inventory_full,error Language Changed language_changed,info Mobs to Kill mobs_to_kill,info Money Given money_given,info Money Taken money_taken,info Quest Cancelled quest_cancelled,quest_canceled,info Items Given items_given,info New Journal Entry new_journal_entry,info Items Taken items_taken,info Blocks to Break blocks_to_break,info Blocks to Place blocks_to_place,info Animals to Breed animals_to_breed,info Mobs to click mobs_to_click,info Fish to catch fish_to_catch,info Players to kill players_to_kill,info Potions to brew potions_to_brew,info Sheep to shear sheep_to_shear,info Configuring NotifyIO's \u00b6 Each NotifyIO has its own set of configuration that can be used.

This can be further limited by location condition and item in hand condition. First argument is type of the click, it can be right, left or any. Next is a block selector . You can also specify loc: argument, followed by standard location format and range: followed by a number (or variable). It will define where the clicked block needs to be, as opposed to \"where you must be\" in location condition. If you add argument cancel , the click will be canceled (chest will not open, button will not be pressed etc.) Action objective contains one property, location . It's a string formatted like X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300 . It does not show the radius. Example action right DOOR:1 conditions:holding_key loc:100;200;300;world range:5 Arrow Shooting: arrow \u00b6 To complete this objective the player needs to shoot the arrow into the target. There are two arguments, location of the target and precision number (radius around location where the arrow must land, should be small). Note that the position of an arrow after hit is on the wall of a full block, which means that shooting not full blocks (like heads) won't give accurate results. Experiment with this objective a bit to make sure you've set the numbers correctly. Example arrow 100.5;200.5;300.5;world 1.1 events:reward conditions:correct_player_position Block: block \u00b6 To complete this objective player must break or place specified amount of blocks. First argument after name is a block selector . Next is amount. It can be more than 0 for placing and less than 0 for destroying. You can also use notify keyword to display messages to the player each time he updates amount of blocks, optionally with the notification interval after colon. This objective has two properties, amount and left . Amount is current amount of blocks in the objective, left is amount needed to complete the objective. Note that it may sometimes be negative! Example block LOG:2 -16 events:reward notify:5 Breed animals: breed \u00b6 This works only on Spigot 1.10.2 and later! This objective is completed by breeding animals of specified type. The first argument is animal type ( types ) and second is amount (positive integer). You can add notify argument to display a message with remaining amount each time the animal is bred, optionally with the notification interval after colon. While you can specify any entity, the objective will be completable only for breedable ones. Example breed cow 10 notify:2 events:reward Put items in a chest: chestput \u00b6 This objective requires the player to put specified items in a specified chest. First argument is a location of the chest, second argument is a list of items (from items.yml file), separated with a comma. You can also add amount of items after a colon. The items will be removed upon completing the objective unless you add items-stay optional argument. Example chestput 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword events:tag,message Eat/drink: consume \u00b6 This objective is completed by eating specified food or drinking specified potion. The only required argument is the ID of an item from items.yml . Example consume tawny_owl events:faster_endurance_regen Crafting: craft \u00b6 To complete this objective the player must craft specified item. First argument is ID of the item, as in items.yml . Next is amount (integer). Crafting objective has two properties, amount and left . Amount is current amount of crafted items and left is amount needed to complete the objective. Example craft saddle 5 events:reward Enchant item: enchant \u00b6 This objectie is completed when the player enchants specified item with specified enchantment. The first argument is an item name, as defined it items.yml . Second one is the enchantment and a level, separated with a colon. If you need to check for multiple enchantments you can add a list of them, separated by colons. Example enchant sword damage_all:1,knockback:1 events:reward Experience: experience \u00b6 This objective can by completed by reaching specified level (default Minecraft experience, whole levels). The conditions are checked when the player levels up, so if they are not met the first time, the player will have to meet them and levelup again. Instruction string consists only from integer - level to reach. Example experience 25 events:reward Delay: delay \u00b6 This objective is just a long, persistent delay for firing events. It will run only after certain amount of time (measured in minutes) and only when player is online and meets all conditions. If a player is offline at that time it will just wait for them to log in. You should use it for example to delete tags so the player can complete quests multiple times. First argument is time, by default in minutes. You can also use ticks or seconds argument to use different units, but keep in mind that it's not very precise - it will complete roughly after the time ends. To control that precision you can specify an optional interval: argument, which specifies how many ticks should pass between checks. One second is 20 ticks. Less makes the objective more precise, at the expense of performance. The rest is just like in other objectives. Delay has two properties, left and date . The first one will show how much time needs to pass before the delay is completed (i.e. 23 days, 5 hours and 45 minutes ), the second one will show a date of completing the objective formatted using date_format setting in config.yml (it will look like the one above every journal entry). Example delay 1000 ticks interval:5 events:event1,event2 Death: die \u00b6 Death objective completes when the player dies meeting all conditions. You can optionally cancel death with cancel argument. It will heal player and optionally teleport him to respawn location. There can be two arguments: cancel , which is optional, and respawn: , which is also optional and only used if there is the cancel argument set. You can add them right after type of objective. Example die cancel respawn:100;200;300;world;90;0 events:teleport Fishing: fish \u00b6 Requires the player to catch a fish. It doesn't have to be a fish, it can also be a treasure or junk. The first argument is material name of the item to catch, optionally with data value after a colon. Second argument must be amount of fish to catch. You can also add notify argument if you want to display progress, optionally with the notification interval after colon. Fishing has the same properties as mob kill objective. Example fish raw_fish:1 5 notify events:tag_fish_caught Interact with entity: interact \u00b6 The player must click on an entity to complete this objective. The first argument is the type of a click. Available values are right , left and any . Second required argument is the mob type . Next is an amount of mobs required to click on. These must be unique, so the player can't simply click twenty times on the same zombie to complete it. There is also an optional name: parameter which specifies what name the entity must have and marked: if the clicked entity needs to be marked by the spawn event (see its description for marking explanation). You can also add notify argument to make the objective notify players whenever they click a correct entity, optionally with the notification interval after colon and cancel if the click shouldn't do what it usually does (i.e. left click won't hurt the entity). This can be limited with an optional loc and range attribute to limit within a range of a location. Example interact right creeper 1 marked:sick condition:syringeInHand cancel Kill player: kill \u00b6 To complete this objective the player needs to kill another player. The first argument is amount of players to kill. You can also specify additional arguments: name: followed by the name will only accept killing players with this name, required: followed by a list of conditions separated with commas will only accept killing players meeting these conditions and notify will display notifications when a player is killed, optionally with the notification interval after colon. Example kill 5 required:team_B Location: location \u00b6 This objective completes when player moves in specified range of specified location and meets all conditions. The first argument after objective's name must be location, the second - radius around the location. It can be a variable. Location objective contains one property, location . It's a string formatted like X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300 . Example location 100;200;300;world 5 condition:test1,!test2 events:test1,test2 Logout: logout \u00b6 To complete this objective the player simply needs to leave the server. Keep in mind that running folder event here will make it run in \"persistent\" mode, since the player is offline on the next tick. Example logout events:delete_objective Password: password \u00b6 This objective requires the player to type the password in the chat. The first argument is the password. All _ characters are replaced with spaces. It's checked with regular expressions (if your password will be ^beton.*beton$ the objective will accept all passwords that starts and ends with beton word ( ^ represents beginning of a string, . represents any character, * allows the previous character (in this case any) repeat any number of times, and $ means end of the string), but you can also use something like beton - it will work). If you want the objective to ignore case of the letters you can add optional ignoreCase argument. For this to work your regular expression needs to use lower case letters. To answer, the player needs to type (in his language, configurable in messages.yml ) password: here goes player's guess . If he fails, the message will not be displayed in the chat. Example password beton ignoreCase events:message,reward Mob Kill: mobkill \u00b6 The player must kill specified amount of mobs You must specify mob type first and then amount. You can find possible mob types here: mob types . Additionally you can specify names for mobs with name:Uber_Zombie , so only killing properly named mobs counts. All _ are replaced with spaces, so in this example you would have to kill 5 zombies with \"Uber Zombie\" above their heads. You can also specify notify keyword to display messages to the player each time he kills a mob, optionally with the notification interval after colon. If you want to accept only mobs marked with spawn event, use marked: argument followed by the keyword used in that event. This objective also has two properties, amount and left . Amount is current amount of killed mobs, left is amount needed to complete the objective. Example mobkill ZOMBIE 5 name:Uber_Zombie conditions:night Potion brewing: brew \u00b6 To complete this objective the player needs to brew specified amount of specified potions. The first argument is a potion ID from items.yml . Second argument is amount of potions. You can optionally add notify argument to make the objective display progress to players, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. The brewing will be accepted if the player was the last one to click the ingredient slot in the brewing stand and there were no matching potions there already. Potion objective has amount and left: properties. Example brew weird_concoction 4 event:add_tag Sheep shearing: shear \u00b6 To complete this objective the player has to shear specified amount of sheep, optionally with specified color and/or name. The first, required argument is amount (integer). Optionally, you can add name: argument with the name and color: with color name . Sheep shearing has the same properties as mob kill objective. Example shear 1 name:Bob color:black Smelting: smelt \u00b6 To complete this objective player must smelt specified item. Note that you must define item as output from furnace, not the ingredient. This one does not support data values (it doesn\u2019t have to). First argument is material name. Next is amount (integer). Smelting has the same properties as crafting objective. Example smelt IRON_INGOT 5 events:reward Step on pressure plate: step \u00b6 To complete this objective the player has to step on pressure plate at given location. The type of plate does not matter. The first and only required argument is a location. If the pressure plate is not present at that location, the objective will not be completable and will log errors in the console. Step objective contains one property, location . It's a string formatted like X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300 . It shows an exact location of the pressure plate. Example step 100;200;300;world events:done Taming: tame \u00b6 To complete this objective player must tame some amount of mobs. valid mob types are: WOLF, OCELOT and HORSE First argument is type, next is amount. Taming has the same properties as mob kill objective. Example tame WOLF 2 events:wolfs_tamed Variable: variable \u00b6 This objective is different. You cannot complete it, it will also ignore defined events and conditions. You can start it and that's it. While this objective is active though, everything the player types in chat (and matches special pattern) will become a variable. The pattern is key: value . So if you type that, it will create a variable called key , which will resolve to value string. These are not global variables, you can access them as objective properties. Let's say you defined this objective as var in your objectives.yml file. You can access the variable in any conversation, event or condition with %objective.var.key% - and in case of this example, it will resolve to value . The player can type something else, and the variable will change its value. Variables are per-player, so my key variable will be different from your key variable, depending on what we were typing in chat. You can have as much variables here as you want. To remove this objective use objective delete event - there is no other way. You can also use variable event to change variables stored in this objective. There is one optional argument, no-chat . If you use it, the objective won't be modified by what players type in chat.

So if you type that, it will create a variable called key , which will resolve to value string. These are not global variables, you can access them as objective properties. Let's say you defined this objective as var in your objectives.yml file. You can access the variable in any conversation, event or condition with %objective.var.key% - and in case of this example, it will resolve to value . The player can type something else, and the variable will change its value. Variables are per-player, so my key variable will be different from your key variable, depending on what we were typing in chat. You can have as much variables here as you want.

You should read it at least once to know what you're dealing with and where to search for information if you ever have any problems. Conversations \u00b6 Each conversation must define name of the NPC (some conversations can be not bound to any NPC, so it\u2019s important to specify it even though an NPC will have a name) and his initial options. quester : Name first : option1, option2 stop : 'true' final_events : event1, event2 interceptor : simple NPC_options : option1 : text : Some text in default language events : event3, event4 conditions : condition1, !condition2 pointers : reply1, reply2 option2 : text : '&3This ends the conversation' player_options : reply1 : text : en : Text in English pl : Tekst po polsku event : event5 condition : '!condition3' pointer : option2 reply2 : text : 'Text containing '' character' Note Configuration files use YAML syntax. Google it if you don't know anything about it. Main rule is that you must use two spaces instead of tabs when going deeper into the hierarchy tree. If you want to write ' character, you must double it and surround the whole text with another ' characters. When writing true or false it also needs to be surrounded with ' . If you want to start the line with & character, the whole line needs to be surrounded with ' . You can check if the file is correct using this tool . quester is name of NPC. It should be the same as name of NPC this conversation is assigned to for greater immersion, but it's your call. first are pointers to options the NPC will use at the beginning of the conversation. He will choose the first one that meets all conditions. You define these options in npc_options branch. final_events are events that will fire on conversation end, no matter how it ends (so you can create e.g. guards attacking the player if he tries to run). You can leave this option out if you don't need any final events. stop determines if player can move away from an NPC while in this conversation (false) or if he's stopped every time he tries to (true). If enabled, it will also suspend the conversation when the player quits, and resume it after he joins back in. This way he will have to finish his conversation no matter what. It needs to be in '' ! You can modify the distance at which the conversation is ended / player is moved back with max_npc_distance option in the config.yml . interceptor optionally set a chat interceptor for this conversation. Multiple interceptors can be provided in a comma-separated list with the first valid one used. NPC_options is a branch with texts said by the NPC. player_options is a branch with options the player can choose. text defines what will display on screen. If you don't want to set any events/conditions/pointers to the option, just skip them. Only text is always required. conditions are names of conditions which must be met for this option to display, separated by commas. events is a list of events that will fire when an option is chosen (either by NPC or a player), defined similarly to conditions. pointer is list of pointers to the opposite branch (from NPC branch it will point to options player can choose from when answering, and from player branch it will point to different NPC reactions). When an NPC wants to say something he will check conditions for the first option (in this case option1 ). If they are met, he will choose it. Otherwise, he will skip to next option (note: conversation ends when there are no options left to choose). After choosing an option NPC will execute any events defined in it, say it, and then the player will see options defined in player_options branch to which pointers setting points, in this case reply1 and reply2 . If the conditions for the player option are not met, the option is simply not displayed, similar to texts from NPC. Player will choose option he wants, and it will point back to other NPC text, which points to next player options and so on. If there are no possible options for player or NPC (either from not meeting any conditions or being not defined) the conversations ends. If the conversation ends unexpectedly, check the console - it could be an error in the configuration. This can and will be a little confusing, so you should name your options, conditions and events in a way which you will understand in the future. Don't worry though, if you make some mistake in configuration, the plugin will tell you this in console when testing a conversation. Also, study the default conversation included with the plugin to fully understand how powerful this system can be. Cross-conversation pointers \u00b6 If you want to create a conversation with multiple NPCs at once or split a huge conversation into smaller, more focused files, you can point to NPC options in other conversation. Just type the pointer as conversation.npc_option . Keep in mind that you can only cross-point to NPC options. It means that you can use those pointers only in first starting options and in all player options. Using them in NPC options will throw errors. Conversation variables \u00b6 You can use variables in the conversations. They will be resolved and displayed to the player when he starts a conversation. A variable generally looks like that: %type.optional.arguments% . Type is a mandatory argument, it defines what kind of variable it is. Optional arguments depend on the type of the variable, i.e. %npc% does not have any additional arguments, but %player% can also have display (it will look like that: %player.display% ). You can find a list of all available variable types in the \"Variables List\" chapter. Note If you use a variable incorrectly (for example trying to get a property of an objective which isn't active for the player, or using %npc% in message event), the variable will be replaced with empty string (\"\"). Translations \u00b6 As you can see in default conversation, there are additional messages in other languages. That's because you can translate your conversations into multiple languages. The players will be albe to choose their preferred one with /questlang command. You can translate every NPC/player option and quester's name. You do this like this: quester : en : Innkeeper pl : Karczmarz de : Gastwirt As said before, the same rule applies to all options and quester's name. The player can choose only from languages present in messages.yml , and if there will be no translation to this language in the conversation, the plugin will fall back to the default language, as defined in config.yml . If that one is not defined, there will be an error. You can also translate journal entries, quest cancelers and message events, more about that later. Conversation displaying \u00b6 By default BetonQuest uses the most native and safe way of displaying a conversation, which is the Minecraft chat. You choose the option by typing their number in. You can however change it with default_conversation_IO option in config.yml file. Default value is simple . By changing it to tellraw you will add a possibility to click on options. Keep in mind that if the chat is quickly flowing, players will sometimes \"miss\" an option and click another one. There is a display type that doesn't suffer from this problem at all, it's called chest . It will display the conversation in an inventory GUI, where the NPC's text and options will be shown as item lore. Alternatively use slowtellraw which provides the npc responses line by line delayed by 0.5 seconds. If you have protocollib then you can use menu . You can control the colors of conversation elements in the config.yml file, in conversation_colors section. Here you must use names of the colors. If you're using the chest display method you can change the option's item to something else than Ender Pearl by adding a prefix to that option's text. The prefix is a name of the material (like in items.yml ) inside curly brackets, with optional damage value after a colon. Example of such option text: {diamond_sword}I want to start a quest! or {wool:10}Purple! In case you want to use a different type of conversation display for a specific conversation you can add conversationIO: <type> setting to the conversation file at the top of the YAML hierarchy, which is the same level as quester or first options). Advanced: Extends \u00b6 Conversation also supports the concept of inheritance. Any option can include the key extends with a comma delimited list of other options of the same time. The first option that does not have any false conditions will have it's text, pointers and events merged with the extending option. The extended option may itself extend other options. Infinite loops are detected. NPC_options : ## Normal Conversation Start start : text : 'What can I do for you' extends : tonight, today ## Useless addition as example tonight : # Always false condition : random 0-1 text : ' tonight?' extends : main_menu today : text : ' today?' extends : main_menu ## Main main_menu main_menu : pointers : i_have_questions, bye In the above example, the option start is extended by both tonight and today , both of whom are extended by main_menu . As tonight has a false condition the today option will win. The start option will have the pointers in main_menu added to it just as if they were defined directly in it and the text will be joined together from today . If you structure your conversation correctly you can make use of this to minimize duplication. Chat Interceptors \u00b6 During chat it can be distracting when messages from other players or system message interfere with the dialogue. A chat interceptor provides a method of intercepting these message and then playing them back later. A default chat interceptor is specified in config.yml by setting default_interceptor . This defaults to simple for the simple interceptor. The chat interceptor can also be set per conversation though the use of interceptor key in the conversation. If you have protocollib installed then you can use the packet interceptor that should intercept anything. Conditions, Events and Objectives \u00b6 Conditions, events and objectives are defined with an \"instruction string\". It's a piece of text, formatted in a specific way, containing the instruction for the condition/event/objective. Thanks to this string they know what should they do. To define the instruction string you will need a reference, few pages below. It describes how something behaves and how it should be created. All instruction strings are defined in appropriate files, for example all conditions are in conditions.yml config. The syntax used to define them looks like this: name: 'the instruction string containing the data' . Apostrophes are optional in most cases, you can find out when to use them by looking up \"YAML syntax\" in Google. Conditions \u00b6 Conditions are the most versatile and useful tools in creating advanced quests. They allow you to control what options are available to player in conversations, how the NPC responds or if the objective will be completed. The reference of all possible conditions is down below. You can negate the condition (revert its output) by adding an exclamation mark ( ! ) at the beginning of it's name (in the place you use it, i.e. in conversations, not in the conditions.yml file). You can use conversation variables instead of numeric arguments in conditions. If the variable fails to resolve (i.e. it will return an empty string) BetonQuest will use 0 instead. Events \u00b6 In certain moments you will want something to happen. Updating the journal, setting tags, giving rewards, all these are done using events. You define them just like conditions, by specifying a name and instruction string. You can find instruction strings to all events in the event reference. At the end of the instruction string you can add conditions: or condition: (with or without s at the end) attribute followed by a list of condition names separated by commas, like conditions:angry,!quest_started . This will make an event fire only when these conditions are met. You can use conversation variables instead of numeric arguments in events. If the variable fails to resolve (i.e. it will return an empty string) BetonQuest will use 0 instead. Objectives \u00b6 Objectives are the main things you will use when creating complex quests. You start them with a special event, objective . You define them in the objectives.yml file, just as you would conditions or events. At the end of the instruction string you can add conditions and events for the objective. Conditions will limit when the objective can be completed (e.g. killing zombies only at given location in quest for defending city gates), and events will fire when the objective is completed (e.g. giving a reward, or setting a tag which will enable collecting a reward from an NPC). You define these like that: conditions:con1,con2 events:event1,event2 at the end of instruction string . Separate them by commas and never use spaces! You can also use singular forms of these arguments: condition: and event: . If you want to start an objective right after it was completed (for example die objective: when you die, teleport you to a special spawnpoint and start die objective again), you can add persistent argument at the end of an instruction string. It will prevent the objective from being completed, although it will run all its events. To cancel such objective you will need to use objective delete event. Objectives are loaded at start-up, but they do not consume resources without player actually having them active. This means that if you have 100 objectives defined, and 20 players doing one objective, 20 another players doing second objective, and the rest objectives are inactive (no one does them), then only 2 objectives will be consuming your server resources, not 100, not 40. Packages \u00b6 All the content you create is organized into packages. Each package must contain the main.yml file with package-specific settings. Additionally it can have conversations directory with conversation files, events.yml , conditions.yml , objectives.yml , items.yml and journal.yml . The default package is called simply \"default\". It is always present, and if you delete it, it will be regenerated with a sample quest. If you want, you can simply ignore the existence of packages and write all your quests in the default one. You will however come to a point, when your files contain hundreds of lines and it gets a little bit confusing. That's why it's better to split your quests into multiple packages, for example \"main\" for the quests in the main city, \"dungeon\" for some interesting dungeon story etc. Each package can be disabled/enabled in the main.yml file, by setting enabled to true or false . It would be limiting if you couldn't interact between packages. That's why you can always access stuff from other packages by prefixing its name with package name. If you're writing a conversation in package village and you want to fire an event reward from package beton , you simply name the event as beton.reward . The plugin will search for reward in beton package instead of the one in which the conversation is defined. All events, conditions, objectives, items and conversations behave this way. Note that you can't cross-reference journal entries! Packages can be nested together in folders. A folder can either contain packages or be a package, never both. The name of such nested package is prefixed by names of all folders, separated with a dash. This directory tree ( main.yml represents a package): BetonQuest/ \u251c\u2500default/ \u2514\u2500quests/ \u251c\u2500village1/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500quest1/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500main.yml \u2502 \u2514\u2500quest2/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500main.yml \u2514\u2500village2/ \u2514\u2500quest1/ \u2514\u2500main.yml contains these packages: default quests-village1-quest1 quests-village1-quest2 quests-village2-quest1 Relative paths \u00b6 You don't have to always specify a full package name. In the example above, if you wanted to reference package quests-village1-quest2 from quests-village1-quest1 , you could write it as _-quest2 - this means \"from the current package ( quest1 ) go up one time and find there package quest2 \". Name _ has special meaning here. Analogously, if you wanted to reference quests-village2-quest1 from that package, you would use _-_-village2-quest1 . Using _ twice will get you to quests package, and from there you're going into village2 and then quest1 . Relative paths can be useful if you want to move your packages between directories. Instead of rewriting every package name to match current directory tree, you can use relative paths and it will just work. It can also be useful if you want to create a downloadable quest package which can be placed anywhere and not just on the root directory ( BetonQuest/ ) or when working with BetonQuest-Editor + BetonQuestUploader combo - quest writers don't have to prefix every package call with their name (this feature will work soon, needs an update in the editor). Unified location formating \u00b6 Whenever you want to define some location in your events, conditions, objectives or any other things, you will define it with this specific format. The location can consist of 2 things: base and vector. Only the base is always required. The base is a core location. Currently there are two types: absolute coordinates and variables. Absolute coordinates are defined like 100;200;300;world , where 100 is X coordinate, 200 is Y, 300 is Z and world is the name of the world. These can have decimal values. If you want you can also add two more numbers at the end, yaw and pitch (these are controlling the rotation, for example in teleportation event, both are needed if you decide to add them; example: 0.5;64;0.5;world;90;-270 ). To use a variable as the location's base it must resolve to a valid absolute coordinates. An example of such variable is %location% , which shows player's exact location. Simply place it instead of coordinates. There is one rule though: you can't use variable base types in events running without players (for example static events or the ones run from folder event after their player left the server). BetonQuest won't be able to resolve the location variable without the player! The vector is a modification of the location. It will be useful if you use global variables instead of base (described in the next subsection) or the base itself is variable, like player . Vectors look like ->(10;2.5;-13) and are added to the end of the base. This will modify the location, X by 10, Y by 2.5 and Z by -13. For example, location written as 100;200;300;world_nether->(10;2.5;-13) will generate a location with X=110, Y=202.5 and Z=287 on world_nether world. Global variables \u00b6 You can insert a global variable in any instruction string. It looks like this: $beton$ (and this one would be called \"beton\"). When the plugin loads that instruction string it will replace those variables with values assigned to them in main.yml file before the instruction string is parsed. This is useful for example when installing a package containing a WorldEdit schematic of the quest building. Instead of going through the whole code to set those locations, names or texts you will only have to specify a few variables (that is, of course, if the author of the package used those variables properly in his code). Note that these variables are something entirely different than conversation variables. Global ones use $ characters and conversation ones use % characters. The former is resolved before the instruction string is parsed while the latter is resolved when the quests are running, usually on a per-player basis. variables : village_location : 100;200;300;world village_name : Concrete Canceling quests \u00b6 If you want to let your players cancel their quest there is a function for that. In main.yml file there is cancel branch. You can specify there quests, which can be canceled, as well as actions that need to be done to actually cancel them. You can find an example in the default package. The arguments you can specify are: name - this will be the name displayed to the player. All _ characters will be converted to spaces. If you want to include other languages you can add here additional options ( en for English etc.) conditions - this is a list of conditions separated by commas. The player needs to meet all those conditions to be able to cancel this quest. Place there the ones which detect that the player has started the quest, but he has not finished it yet. objectives - list of all objectives used in this quest. They will be canceled without firing their events. tags - this is a list of tags that will be deleted. Place here all tags that you use during the quest. points - list of all categories that will be entirely deleted. journal - these journal entries will be deleted when canceling the quest. events - if you want to do something else when canceling the quest (like punishing the player), list the events here. loc - this is a location to which the player will be teleported when canceling the quest (defined as in teleport event); To cancel the quest you need to open your backpack and select a \"cancel\" button (by default a bone, can be changes by naming an item \"cancel_button\" inside default package). There will be a list of quests which can be canceled. Just select the one that interests you and it will be canceled. Global objectives \u00b6 If you want a objective to be active for every player right after joining you can create a global objective. This is done by adding global argument to the instruction of the objective. When you then reload BetonQuest it is started for all online players and also will be started for every player who joins. To prevent the objective from being started every time a player joins a tag is set for the player whenever the objective is started and as long as the player has the tag the objective wont be started again if the player joins. These tags follow syntax <package>.global-<id> , where <id> is the objectives id and <package> the package where the objective is located. Possible use cases would be a quest which starts if a player reaches a specific location or breaks a specific block. Example: start_quest_mine : 'location 100;200;300;world 5 events:start_quest_mine_folder global' Static events \u00b6 Static events are events that will fire at the specified time of the day. They are not tied to a specific player, so not all of event types can be used as static. (Which player should receive a tag or objective? From which one should the items be taken?) Also, static events cannot have conditions defined ( event-conditions: argument), as the plugin cannot check any condition without the player. Events, that can be used as static are flagges with static keyword in this documentation. You can define your static events in main.yml file under static section, as such: static : '09:00' : beton '23:59' : lightning_strike '11:23' : some_command The hour must be in '' to avoid problems, it needs leading zero if less than 10. beton , lightnint_strike etc. are IDs of events. There can only be one event specified, but it can be of type \"folder\". Journal \u00b6 The journal is a book in which all your adventures are described. You can obtain it by typing /j command or /b and selecting it from backpack. You cannot put it into any chests, item frames and so on. If you ever feel the need to get rid of your journal, just drop it - it will return to your backpack. The journal is updated with the journal event, and the text inside is defined in journal.yml config file. If you update these texts and reload the plugin, all players' journals will reflect changes. Colors in the journal can be altered in config.yml. The entries can use color codes, but the color will be lost between pages. The journal by default appears in the last slot of the hotbar. If you want to change that use default_journal_slot option in config.yml , experiment with different settings until you're ok with it. If you want to translate the entry do the same thing as with conversation option - go to new line, add language ID and the journal text for every language you want to include. You can control behavior of the journal in config.yml file, in journal section. chars_per_page specifies how many characters will be placed on a single page. If you set it too high, the text will overflow outside of the page, too low, there will be too much pages. one_entry_per_page allows you to place every entry on a single page. The chars_per_page setting is in this case ignored, BetonQuest will put entire entry on that page. reversed_order allows you to reverse order of entries and hide_date lets you remove the date from journal entries. You can control colors in the journal in journal_colors section in config.yml : date is a color of date of every entry, line is a color of lines separating entries and text is just a color of a text. You need to use standard color codes without & (eg. '4' for dark red). You can also add a main page to the journal. It's a list of texts, which will show only if specified conditions are met. You can define them in the main.yml file, in the journal_main_page section: journal_main_page : title : priority : 1 text : en : '&eThe Journal' pl : '&eDziennik' conditions : 'quest_started,!quest_completed' Each string can have text in different languages, list of conditions separated by commas (these must be met for the text to show in the journal) and priority , which controls the order of texts. You can use conversation variables in the texts, but they will only be updated when the player gets his journal with the /journal command. Color codes are supported. If you want your main page take a separate page (so entries will be displayed on next free page), set full_main_page in config.yml to \"true\". Tags \u00b6 Tags are little pieces of text you can assign to player and then check if he has them. They are particularly useful to determine if player has started or completed quest. They are given with tag event and checked with tag condition. All tags are bound to a package, so if you add beton tag from within the default package, the tag will look like default.beton . If you're checking for beton tag from within default package, you're actually checking for default.beton . If you want to check a tag from another package, then you just need to prefix it's name with that package, for example quest.beton . Points \u00b6 Points are like tags, but with amount. You can earn them for doing quest, talking with NPC\u2019s, basically for everything you want. You can also take the points away, even to negative numbers. Points can be divided to categories, so the ones from beton category won\u2019t mix with points from quests group. Of course then you can check if player has (or doesn\u2019t have) certain amount and do something based on this condition. They can be used as counter for specific number of quest done, as a reputation system in villages and even NPC\u2019s attitude to player. NPCs \u00b6 Conversations can be assigned to NPCs. You do it in the main.yml file inside a package, in \"npcs\" section: npcs : '0' : innkeeper 'Innkeeper' : innkeeper The first string is the name of the NPC, second one is the corresponding conversation name. In case you use Citizens, name is the ID of an NPC ( don't try to put Citizens NPC's name here, it must be the ID ). To acquire it just select the NPC and type /npc . If you don't want to use Citizens, you can also build NPCs as any other building in Minecraft: Place somewhere a block of stained clay, no matter the color. Then place a head on top of it (type doesn't matter, it must be head). Now place a sign on the side of the clay block (it can be on it's back) and type in the first line [NPC] , and on the second line the ID of the NPC (in case of the above code example, the ID would be Innkeeper ). You need to have permission betonquest.createnpc for that. Congratulations, you have created the NPC. Now you can add levers (hands) to it and maybe even a fence gate (legs). Conversation is started by right clicking it's head. Note When using Citizens ID's they must be enclosed in quotes. Items \u00b6 Items in BetonQuest are defined in items.yml file. Each item has an instruction string, similarly to events, conditions etc. Basic syntax is very simple: item : BLOCK_SELECTOR other arguments... BLOCK_SELECTOR is a type of the item. It doesn't have to be all in uppercase. Other arguments specify data like name of the item, lore, enchantments or potion effects. There are two categories of these arguments: the ones you can apply to every item and type specific arguments. Examples would be name (for every item type) and text (only in books). Every argument is used in two ways: when creating an item and when checking if some existing item matches the instruction. The first case is pretty straightforward - BetonQuest takes all data you specified and creates an item, simple as that. Second case is more complicated. You can require some property of the item to exist, other not to exist, or skip this property check altogether. You can also accept an item only if some value (like enchantment level) is greater/less than x . You can use wildcards in the BLOCK_SELECTOR to match multiple types of items. These are arguments that can be applied to every item: name - the display name of the item. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. If you want to specifically say that the item must not have any name, use none keyword. lore - text under the item's name. Default styling of lore is purple and italic. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. To make a new line use ; character. If you require the item not to have lore at all, use none keyword. By default lore will match only if all lines are exactly the same. If you want to accept all items which contain specified lines (and/or more lines), add lore-containing argument to the instruction string. data - data value of the item. An example of this would be different wool colors or damage of a pickaxe. You can require an exact value by specifying a number, or a value greater/less (and equal) than specified by adding + / - character at the end of the number. enchants - a list of enchantments and their levels. Each enchantment consists of these things, separated by colons: name level (a positive number) For example damage_all:3 is Sharpness III . You can specify additional enchantments by separating them with commas. You can require the item not to have any enchantments by using none keyword. You can also add + / - character to the enchantment level to make the check require levels greater/less (and equal) than specified. If you don't care about the level, replace the number with a question mark. By default all specified enchantments are required. If you want to check if the item contains a matching enchantment (and/or more enchants), add enchants-containing argument to the instruction string. Each specified enchantment will be required on the item by default unless you prefix its name with none- , for example none-knockback means that the item must not have any knockback enchantment. Do not use none- prefix unless you're using enchants-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and will break the check! unbreakable - this makes the item unbreakable. You can specify it either as unbreakable or unbreakable:true to require an item to be unbreakable. If you want to check if the item is breakable, use unbreakable:false . Examples : name:&4Sword_made_of_Holy_Concrete name:none lore:&cOnly_this_sword_can_kill_the_Lord_Ruler lore:&2Quest_Item lore-containing lore:none data:5 data:500- enchants:damage_all:3+,none-knockback enchants:power:? enchants-containing enchants:none unbreakable unbreakable:false These are the arguments that can be applied only to specific item types: Books \u00b6 This applies to a written book and a book and quill. title - the title of a book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. If you want to specifically say that the book must not have any title, use none keyword. author - the author of a book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces, you cannot use color codes here. If you want to specifically say that the book must not have any author, use none keyword. text - the text of the book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. The text will wrap to the next page if amount of characters exceeds journal.chars_per_page setting in config.yml . If you want to manually wrap the page, use | character. To go to new line use \\n . Keep in mind that you can't use any spaces here, you must only use underscores ( _ ). This needs to be a single argument, even if it's really long. If you don't want the book to have any text, use none keyword instead. Examples : title:Malleus_Maleficarum author:&eGallus_Anonymus text:Lorem_ipsum_dolor_sit_amet,\\nconsectetur_adipiscing_elit.|Pellentesque_ligula_urna(...) Potions \u00b6 This applies to potions, splash potions and lingering potions. type - type of a potion. Here's the list of possible types. Do not mistake this for a custom effect, this argument corresponds to the default vanilla potion types. extended - extended property of the potion (you can achieve it in-game by adding redstone). It can be specified as extended or extended:true . If you want to check the potion that is NOT extended, use upgraded:false . upgraded - upgraded property of the potion (you can achieve it in-game by adding glowstone). It can be specified as upgraded or upgraded:true . If you want to check the potion that is NOT upgraded, use upgraded:false . effects - a list of custom effects. These are independent of the potion type. The effects must be separated by commas. Each effect consists of these things, separated by colons: type (this is different stuff that the link above!) power duration (in seconds) An example would be WITHER:2:30 , which is a wither effect of level 2 for 30 seconds. If you want to target only potions without custom effects, use none keyword. You can target potions with level and time greater/less (and equal) than specified with + / - character after the number. If you don't care about the level/time, you can replace them with question mark. By default all specified effects are required. If you want to check if the potion contains these effects among others, add effects-containing argument to the instruction string. Now if you want to make sure the potion doesn't contain a specific effect, prefix the effect name with none- . Don't use that prefix unless you're also using effects-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and it will break the check. Examples : type:instant_heal extended upgraded:false effects:poison:1+:?,slow:?:45- effects:none-weakness,invisibility:?:? effects-containing Heads \u00b6 This applies to human heads. owner - this is the name of the head owner. It will not use color codes nor replace underscores with spaces. If you want to check for heads without any owner, use none keyword. Examples : owner:Co0sh owner:none Leather armor \u00b6 This applies to all parts of leather armor. color - this is the color of the armor piece. It can be either one of these values , a hexadecimal RGB value prefixed with # character or its decimal representation without the prefix. You can also check if the armor piece doesn't have any color with none keyword. Examples : color:light_blue color:#ff00ff color:none Fireworks \u00b6 This applies to fireworks. firework - this is a list of effects of the firework rocket. They are separated by commas. Each effect consists of these things separated by colons: effect type a list of main colors (refer to leather armor colors above for syntax) separated by semicolons a list of fade colors true / false keyword for trail effect true / false keyword for flicker. Note the separation characters, this is important: commas separate effects, colons separate effect properties, semicolons separate colors. If you want to target fireworks without any effects, use none keyword. If you want to target any effect type, use question mark instead of the effect name. If you don't want the effect to have any main/fade colors, use none keyword in the place of colors. If you don't care about main/fade colors, use question marks in that place. If you don't care about trail/flicker effect, use question marks instead of true / false keyword. By default the check will require all specified effects to be present on the firework. You can check if the firework contains specified effects among others by adding firework-containing argument to the instruction string. To match the item which must not have an effect, prefix the effect name with none- keyword. Don't use that prefix unless you're also using firework-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and will break the check. power - flight duration of the firework, in levels. You can use + / - character to target greater/less (and equal) levels. Examples : firework:ball:red;white:green;blue:true:true,ball_large:green;yellow:pink;black:false:false firework:burst:?:none:?:? firework-containing firework:none-creeper firework-containing firework:none power:3 power:2+ Firework charges \u00b6 This applies to firework charges. firework - this is almost the same as fireworks. You can only specify a single effect and the power argument has no effects. Backpack \u00b6 Sometimes you'll want some items to be persistent over death. If the player has lost them the quest would be broken. You can add a apecific line to item's lore to make it persistent ( &2Quest_Item by default, _ is a space in item's definition). Note that this must be a whole new line in the lore! Such item wouldn't be dropped on death, instead it would be placed in player's backpack. Example : important_sword : 'DIAMOND_SWORD name:Sword_for_destroying__The_Concrete lore:Made_of_pure_Mithril;&2Quest_Item' To open your backpack just type /j command. The inventory window will open, displaying your stored items. The first slot is always the journal, and if you get it, the slot will stay empty. You can transfer quest items back and forth between inventories by clicking on them. Left click will transfer just one item, right click will try to transfer all items. Normal items cannot be stored into the backpack, so it's not an infinite inventory. If you will ever have more than one page of quest items, the buttons will appear. You can customize those buttons by creating previous_button and next_button items in items.yml file. Their name will be overwritten with the one defined in messages.yml . Quest items cannot be dropped in any way other than using them. This way you can create a quest for eating cookies by giving the player a stack of cookies flagged as quest items and not continuing until there are no more cookies in his inventory/backpack. The player cannot drop the cookies, so he must eat every one of them to complete the quest. Don't worry if the item-dropping filter isn't working for your items when you're in creative mode - it's not a bug. It's a feature. Creative-mode players should be able to easily put quest items in containers like TreasureChests. Party \u00b6 Parties are very simple. So simple, that they are hard to understand if you already know some other party system. Basically, they don't even have to be created before using them. Parties are defined directly in conditions/events ( party event, party conditions, check them out in the reference lists below). In such instruction strings the first argument is a number - range. It defines the radius where the party members will be looked for. Second is a list of conditions. Only the players that meet those conditions will be considered as members of the party. It's most intuitive for players, as they don't have to do anything to be in a party - no commands, no GUIs, just starting the same quest or having the same item - you choose what and when makes the party. To understand better how it works I will show you an example of party event. Let's say that every player has an objective of pressing a button. When one of them presses it, this event is fired: party_reward : party 50 quest_started cancel_button,teleport_to_dungeon Now, it means that all players that: are in radius of 50 blocks around the player who pressed the button AND meet quest_started condition will receive cancel_button and teleport_to_dungeon events. The first one will cancel the quest for pressing the button for the others (it's no longer needed), the second one will teleport them somewhere. Now, imagine there is a player on the other side of the world who also meets quest_started condition - he won't be teleported into the dungeon, because he was not with the other players (not in 50 blocks range). Now, there were a bunch of other players running around the button, but they didn't meet the quest_started condition. They also won't be teleported (they didn't start this quest). Block Selectors \u00b6 When specifying a way of matching a block, a block selector is used. This differs a little depending if your Minecraft version is older than 1.13 or newer. Pre 1.13 Minecraft \u00b6 The format of a block selector is: material:data Where: material - What material the block is made of. You can look this up in this list . data - (optional) A number representing the data of the block. If left out then the selector will match all data types. Examples: LOG - Matches all LOGS LOG:1 - Matches SPRUCE LOGS 1.13 and above \u00b6 The format of a block selector is: prefix:material[state=value,...] Where: prefix - (optional) The material prefix. If left out then it will be assumed to be 'minecraft' material - The material the block is made of. You can look this up in this list . Wildcards are supported (both * and ?). state - (optional) The block states can be provided in a comma separated list surrounded by square brackets. You can look up states in this list . Any states left out will be ignored when matching. Examples: minecraft:stone - Matches all blocks of type STONE redstone_wire - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE redstone_wire[power=5] - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE and which have a power of 5 redstone_wire[power=5,facing=1] - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE and which have both a power of 5 and are facing 1 *_LOG - Matches all LOGS * - Matches everything *[waterlogged=true] - Matches all waterlogged blocks","title":"Reference"},{"location":"User-Documentation/Reference/#reference","text":"This chapter describes all aspects of BetonQuest in one place.

Google it if you don't know anything about it. Main rule is that you must use two spaces instead of tabs when going deeper into the hierarchy tree. If you want to write ' character, you must double it and surround the whole text with another ' characters. When writing true or false it also needs to be surrounded with ' . If you want to start the line with & character, the whole line needs to be surrounded with ' . You can check if the file is correct using this tool . quester is name of NPC. It should be the same as name of NPC this conversation is assigned to for greater immersion, but it's your call. first are pointers to options the NPC will use at the beginning of the conversation. He will choose the first one that meets all conditions. You define these options in npc_options branch. final_events are events that will fire on conversation end, no matter how it ends (so you can create e.g. guards attacking the player if he tries to run). You can leave this option out if you don't need any final events. stop determines if player can move away from an NPC while in this conversation (false) or if he's stopped every time he tries to (true). If enabled, it will also suspend the conversation when the player quits, and resume it after he joins back in. This way he will have to finish his conversation no matter what. It needs to be in '' ! You can modify the distance at which the conversation is ended / player is moved back with max_npc_distance option in the config.yml . interceptor optionally set a chat interceptor for this conversation. Multiple interceptors can be provided in a comma-separated list with the first valid one used. NPC_options is a branch with texts said by the NPC. player_options is a branch with options the player can choose. text defines what will display on screen. If you don't want to set any events/conditions/pointers to the option, just skip them. Only text is always required. conditions are names of conditions which must be met for this option to display, separated by commas. events is a list of events that will fire when an option is chosen (either by NPC or a player), defined similarly to conditions. pointer is list of pointers to the opposite branch (from NPC branch it will point to options player can choose from when answering, and from player branch it will point to different NPC reactions). When an NPC wants to say something he will check conditions for the first option (in this case option1 ). If they are met, he will choose it. Otherwise, he will skip to next option (note: conversation ends when there are no options left to choose). After choosing an option NPC will execute any events defined in it, say it, and then the player will see options defined in player_options branch to which pointers setting points, in this case reply1 and reply2 . If the conditions for the player option are not met, the option is simply not displayed, similar to texts from NPC. Player will choose option he wants, and it will point back to other NPC text, which points to next player options and so on. If there are no possible options for player or NPC (either from not meeting any conditions or being not defined) the conversations ends. If the conversation ends unexpectedly, check the console - it could be an error in the configuration. This can and will be a little confusing, so you should name your options, conditions and events in a way which you will understand in the future. Don't worry though, if you make some mistake in configuration, the plugin will tell you this in console when testing a conversation.

You do this like this: quester : en : Innkeeper pl : Karczmarz de : Gastwirt As said before, the same rule applies to all options and quester's name. The player can choose only from languages present in messages.yml , and if there will be no translation to this language in the conversation, the plugin will fall back to the default language, as defined in config.yml .

You choose the option by typing their number in. You can however change it with default_conversation_IO option in config.yml file. Default value is simple . By changing it to tellraw you will add a possibility to click on options. Keep in mind that if the chat is quickly flowing, players will sometimes \"miss\" an option and click another one. There is a display type that doesn't suffer from this problem at all, it's called chest . It will display the conversation in an inventory GUI, where the NPC's text and options will be shown as item lore. Alternatively use slowtellraw which provides the npc responses line by line delayed by 0.5 seconds. If you have protocollib then you can use menu . You can control the colors of conversation elements in the config.yml file, in conversation_colors section. Here you must use names of the colors. If you're using the chest display method you can change the option's item to something else than Ender Pearl by adding a prefix to that option's text. The prefix is a name of the material (like in items.yml ) inside curly brackets, with optional damage value after a colon. Example of such option text: {diamond_sword}I want to start a quest! or {wool:10}Purple!

Conditions will limit when the objective can be completed (e.g. killing zombies only at given location in quest for defending city gates), and events will fire when the objective is completed (e.g. giving a reward, or setting a tag which will enable collecting a reward from an NPC). You define these like that: conditions:con1,con2 events:event1,event2 at the end of instruction string . Separate them by commas and never use spaces! You can also use singular forms of these arguments: condition: and event: . If you want to start an objective right after it was completed (for example die objective: when you die, teleport you to a special spawnpoint and start die objective again), you can add persistent argument at the end of an instruction string. It will prevent the objective from being completed, although it will run all its events. To cancel such objective you will need to use objective delete event. Objectives are loaded at start-up, but they do not consume resources without player actually having them active. This means that if you have 100 objectives defined, and 20 players doing one objective, 20 another players doing second objective, and the rest objectives are inactive (no one does them), then only 2 objectives will be consuming your server resources, not 100, not 40.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"User-Documentation/Reference/#packages","text":"All the content you create is organized into packages. Each package must contain the main.yml file with package-specific settings. Additionally it can have conversations directory with conversation files, events.yml , conditions.yml , objectives.yml , items.yml and journal.yml . The default package is called simply \"default\". It is always present, and if you delete it, it will be regenerated with a sample quest. If you want, you can simply ignore the existence of packages and write all your quests in the default one. You will however come to a point, when your files contain hundreds of lines and it gets a little bit confusing. That's why it's better to split your quests into multiple packages, for example \"main\" for the quests in the main city, \"dungeon\" for some interesting dungeon story etc. Each package can be disabled/enabled in the main.yml file, by setting enabled to true or false . It would be limiting if you couldn't interact between packages. That's why you can always access stuff from other packages by prefixing its name with package name. If you're writing a conversation in package village and you want to fire an event reward from package beton , you simply name the event as beton.reward . The plugin will search for reward in beton package instead of the one in which the conversation is defined. All events, conditions, objectives, items and conversations behave this way. Note that you can't cross-reference journal entries! Packages can be nested together in folders. A folder can either contain packages or be a package, never both. The name of such nested package is prefixed by names of all folders, separated with a dash.

Name _ has special meaning here. Analogously, if you wanted to reference quests-village2-quest1 from that package, you would use _-_-village2-quest1 . Using _ twice will get you to quests package, and from there you're going into village2 and then quest1 . Relative paths can be useful if you want to move your packages between directories. Instead of rewriting every package name to match current directory tree, you can use relative paths and it will just work. It can also be useful if you want to create a downloadable quest package which can be placed anywhere and not just on the root directory ( BetonQuest/ ) or when working with BetonQuest-Editor + BetonQuestUploader combo - quest writers don't have to prefix every package call with their name (this feature will work soon, needs an update in the editor).","title":"Relative paths"},{"location":"User-Documentation/Reference/#unified-location-formating","text":"Whenever you want to define some location in your events, conditions, objectives or any other things, you will define it with this specific format. The location can consist of 2 things: base and vector. Only the base is always required. The base is a core location. Currently there are two types: absolute coordinates and variables. Absolute coordinates are defined like 100;200;300;world , where 100 is X coordinate, 200 is Y, 300 is Z and world is the name of the world. These can have decimal values. If you want you can also add two more numbers at the end, yaw and pitch (these are controlling the rotation, for example in teleportation event, both are needed if you decide to add them; example: 0.5;64;0.5;world;90;-270 ). To use a variable as the location's base it must resolve to a valid absolute coordinates. An example of such variable is %location% , which shows player's exact location. Simply place it instead of coordinates. There is one rule though: you can't use variable base types in events running without players (for example static events or the ones run from folder event after their player left the server). BetonQuest won't be able to resolve the location variable without the player! The vector is a modification of the location. It will be useful if you use global variables instead of base (described in the next subsection) or the base itself is variable, like player . Vectors look like ->(10;2.5;-13) and are added to the end of the base. This will modify the location, X by 10, Y by 2.5 and Z by -13. For example, location written as 100;200;300;world_nether->(10;2.5;-13) will generate a location with X=110, Y=202.5 and Z=287 on world_nether world.","title":"Unified location formating"},{"location":"User-Documentation/Reference/#global-variables","text":"You can insert a global variable in any instruction string.

This is useful for example when installing a package containing a WorldEdit schematic of the quest building. Instead of going through the whole code to set those locations, names or texts you will only have to specify a few variables (that is, of course, if the author of the package used those variables properly in his code).

Colors in the journal can be altered in config.yml. The entries can use color codes, but the color will be lost between pages. The journal by default appears in the last slot of the hotbar. If you want to change that use default_journal_slot option in config.yml , experiment with different settings until you're ok with it. If you want to translate the entry do the same thing as with conversation option - go to new line, add language ID and the journal text for every language you want to include. You can control behavior of the journal in config.yml file, in journal section. chars_per_page specifies how many characters will be placed on a single page. If you set it too high, the text will overflow outside of the page, too low, there will be too much pages. one_entry_per_page allows you to place every entry on a single page.

Each item has an instruction string, similarly to events, conditions etc. Basic syntax is very simple: item : BLOCK_SELECTOR other arguments... BLOCK_SELECTOR is a type of the item. It doesn't have to be all in uppercase. Other arguments specify data like name of the item, lore, enchantments or potion effects. There are two categories of these arguments: the ones you can apply to every item and type specific arguments. Examples would be name (for every item type) and text (only in books). Every argument is used in two ways: when creating an item and when checking if some existing item matches the instruction. The first case is pretty straightforward - BetonQuest takes all data you specified and creates an item, simple as that. Second case is more complicated. You can require some property of the item to exist, other not to exist, or skip this property check altogether. You can also accept an item only if some value (like enchantment level) is greater/less than x . You can use wildcards in the BLOCK_SELECTOR to match multiple types of items. These are arguments that can be applied to every item: name - the display name of the item. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. If you want to specifically say that the item must not have any name, use none keyword. lore - text under the item's name. Default styling of lore is purple and italic. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. To make a new line use ; character. If you require the item not to have lore at all, use none keyword. By default lore will match only if all lines are exactly the same. If you want to accept all items which contain specified lines (and/or more lines), add lore-containing argument to the instruction string. data - data value of the item. An example of this would be different wool colors or damage of a pickaxe. You can require an exact value by specifying a number, or a value greater/less (and equal) than specified by adding + / - character at the end of the number. enchants - a list of enchantments and their levels. Each enchantment consists of these things, separated by colons: name level (a positive number) For example damage_all:3 is Sharpness III . You can specify additional enchantments by separating them with commas. You can require the item not to have any enchantments by using none keyword. You can also add + / - character to the enchantment level to make the check require levels greater/less (and equal) than specified. If you don't care about the level, replace the number with a question mark. By default all specified enchantments are required. If you want to check if the item contains a matching enchantment (and/or more enchants), add enchants-containing argument to the instruction string.

Example %item.stick.amount% Location: location \u00b6 This variable resolves to player's current location, formatted as an absolute location format (more about it in the Reference chapter). The location will contain yaw and pitch. You can use it instead of coordinates as location arguments in events, conditions and objectives. Example %location% Calculate mathematical expression: math.calc \u00b6 This variable allows you to perform a calculation based on other variables (for example point or objective variables) and resolves to the result of the specified calculation. The variable always starts with math.calc: , followed by the calculation which should be calculated. Supported operations are + , - , * , / and ^ . You can use ( ) and [ ] braces and also calculate absolute values with | | (but don't use this in the command event as it splits the commands at every | ). If you want to use variables in the calculation, don't put % around them. Example %math.calc:100*(15-point.reputation.amount)% NPC: npc \u00b6 It's a very simple variable. It's replaced by the name of the NPC in player's language. Example %npc% Objective: objective \u00b6 Using this variable you can display a property of an objective. The first argument is an ID of the objective as defined in objectives.yml (not the type). Make sure that the player has this objective active or it will be replaced with nothing (\"\"). Second argument is the name of a property you want to display. All properties are described in \"Objectives List\" chapter. Example %objective.kill_zombies.left% Player: player \u00b6 This variable will be replaced with the name of the player. If you add display argument, it will use display name instead of real name. Example %player.display% Point: point \u00b6 This variable displays the amount of points you have in some category or amount of points you need to have to reach a number. The first argument is the name of a category and the second argument is either amount or left:x , where x is a number. Example %point.reputation.left:15% Version: version \u00b6 This variable displays the version of the plugin. You can optionally add the name of the plugin as an argument to display version of another plugin.
